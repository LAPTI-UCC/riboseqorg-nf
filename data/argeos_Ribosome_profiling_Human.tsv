GSE140995	Homo sapiens	12	Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL16791	Multiple links between 5-methylcytosine content of mRNA and translation	2019-11-25	5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a prevalent base modification in tRNA and rRNA but it also occurs more broadly in the transcriptome, including in mRNA. In pursuit of potential links of m5C with mRNA translation, we performed polysome profiling of human HeLa cell lysates and subjected RNA from resultant fractions to efficient bisulfite conversion followed by RNA sequencing (bsRNA-seq). Bioinformatic filters for rigorous site calling were devised to reduce technical noise. We obtained ~1,000 candidate m5C sites in the wider transcriptome, most of which were found in exonic regions of mRNA. Multiple novel sites were validated by amplicon-specific bsRNA-seq in independent samples of either human HeLa, LNCap and PrEC cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of either the NSUN2 or TRDMT1 m5C:RNA methyltransferases showed a clear dependence on NSUN2 for the majority of tested sites in mRNA and noncoding RNA. Candidate m5C sites in mRNAs are enriched in 5’UTRs and near start codons, and commonly embedded in a local context reminiscent of the NSUN2-dependent m5C sites found in the variable loop of tRNA. Analysing mRNA sites across the polysome profile revealed that non-conversion levels, at bulk and for many individual sites, were inversely correlated with ribosome association. Altogether, these findings emphasise the major role of NSUN2 in making this mark transcriptome-wide and further substantiate a functional interdependence of cytosine methylation level with mRNA translation	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140995	BMC biology	6.723	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-020-00769-5	{BMC biology (6.723): 10.1186/s12915-020-00769-5}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA591627	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA591627	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP233220	[Overal design]Bisulfite RNA sequencing of HeLa cell polysome profiling-derived samples representing different translational states; in biological triplicates.; [Treatment]'Cells were incubated with 0.1mg/ml cycloheximide for 3 minutes prior to lysate preparation'; [Growth]'6x106 HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 2mM L-glutamine until 70% confluent'; [Extraction]'Cell lysates were cleared and polysome gradients obtained by sucrose density centrfugation.

GSE102204	Mus musculus	20	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13112	Transcriptome and translatome profiling from brains of  a mouse model of severe SMA	2017-08-03	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, with an incidence of around 1 in 6,000-10,000 live births. SMA is caused by low levels of full-length survival of motor neuron protein (SMN). Approximately 95% of SMA cases in humans are caused by homozygous deletion of SMN1, with a smaller number caused by discrete mutations within the gene. In concert with other RNA binding proteins, SMN forms complexes both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of neurons. As such, SMN protein has housekeeping roles in the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. In addition, SMN localises to dendrites, synapses and axons in vivo and in vitro, where it is part of messenger RNP (mRNP) complexes with well-known roles in the transport of mRNA. These cellular processes are tightly linked to local translation, suggesting that SMN may play a pivotal role in its regulation. We employed next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and quantify RNAs associated with polysomes (POL-Seq) in parallel with total cytoplasmic RNA (RNA-Seq) in an established mouse model of severe SMA at both early and late-symptomatic stages. This approach enables the simultaneous identification of variations in RNA populations at both translatome (RNAs engagement with polysomes) and transcriptome (steady state cytoplasmic RNAs) levels.

Experiments were performed in biological triplicate for late-symptomatic mice, and in biological duplicate for early-symptomatic mice, for a total of 20 samples.; [Treatment]'Early symptomatic brains were P5 and late symptomatic brains were P7. Neonatal mice were euthanized by overdose of anaesthetic, before decapitation to allow the brain to be removed. Following isolation, all tissues were immediately snap-frozen on dry ice and then transferred to -80 °C for storage.'; [Growth]'The ‘Taiwanese’ mouse model of severe SMA was used in this study (Hsieh-Li et al., 2000; Riessland et al., 2010; Somers et al., 2015). All mice were on a congenic FVB background, with colonies at the University of Edinburgh established from breeding pairs purchased from Jackson Labs. ‘Taiwanese’ SMA mice (Smn-/-; SMN2tg/0) carry two copies of SMN2 on one allele and are on a null murine Smn background. Litters were retrospectively genotyped using standard PCR protocols. All mice were housed within the animal care facilities in Edinburgh under standard SPF conditions. All animal procedures and breeding were performed in accordance with University of Edinburgh institutional guidelines and under appropriate project and personal licenses granted by the UK Home Office.'; [Extraction]'Cytoplasmic lysates from frozen mouse tissues and polysomal profiling were performed as described previously (Lunelli et al., 2016).RNA was extracted from control and SMA brains (at early and late symptomatic stage).

GSE131074	Homo sapiens	15	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL20795	Ribosome profiling of eIF3e-KD MCF-10a cells	2019-05-13	eIF3 is a multi-subunit complex thought to execute numerous functions in canonical translation initiation, including mRNA recruitment to the 40S ribosome, scanning for the start codon, and inhibition of 60S subunit joining 1–3. eIF3 was also found to interact with 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors 4, but a direct involvement in translation elongation has never been demonstrated. Using selective ribosome profiling, we made the unexpected observation that eIF3 remains bound to post-initiation 80S ribosomes, followed by release after translation of ~50 codons. Furthermore, eIF3 deficiency reduces early ribosomal elongation speed, particularly on mRNAs encoding proteins associated with membrane-associated functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins and abnormal mitochondrial and lysosomal physiology. Accordingly, heterozygous eIF3e+/- knockout mice accumulate giant mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength with age. Hence, in addition to its canonical role in translation initiation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for normal muscle health.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131074	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.003	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.003}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA542601	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA542601	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP198221	[Overal design]Using si-RNA to do eIF3e-KD then do the ribosome profiling samples with total RNA, 3 replicates.; [Treatment]'The cells were treated with 20nM si-control or si-eIF3e for 72h.'; [Growth]'MCF-10a cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium with 0.5mg/mL hydrocortisone, 10µg/mL insulin, 20ng/mL EGF, 5% serum, 1X Pen/Strep, and incubate in 37℃ with 5% CO2.'; [Extraction]'The RNA were extracted with TRIzol reagent(thermo ambion, REF,15596018) and its standard protocol.\nAfter clarification, 5 OD260 units of lysates were treated with 450 units of RNaseI (Ambion) for 45 min at RT.

However, many tumors escape by activating multiple cellular pathways that induce immunosuppression. One pivotal immune-suppressive mechanism is the production of Tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by IFNγ-induced IDO1 enzyme production. However, phase III clinical trials using chemical inhibition of IDO1 in combination with PD1 pathway blockade failed to improve melanoma treatment, suggesting incomplete understanding of the role of IDO1 and the consequent Tryptophan degradation on mRNA translation and cancer progression. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged IFNγ treatment on mRNA translation in melanoma cells by ribosome profiling. Our results suggest that IFNγ-induced IDO1-mediated Tryptophan depletion may play a key role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells, by inducing the production and presentation of aberrant peptides.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142822	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03054-1	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/s41586-020-03054-1}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA598557	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA598557	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP239266	[Overal design]RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry to measure mRNA levels, mRNA translation, and protein levels.; [Treatment]'cell where cultured with Tryptophan-free RPMI 1640 media (custom purchased from Biological Industries)/ Tyrosine-free medium (custom purchased from Cell Culture Technologies) for 48h, IFNγ (PeproTech) was used at 250 U/mL for the indicated durations of time.

How the loss of FMRP alters protein expression and astroglial functions remains essentially unknown. Here we showed that selective loss of astroglial FMRP in vivo up-regulates a brain-enriched miRNA, miR-128-3p, in mouse and human FMRP-deficient astroglia, which suppresses developmental expression of astroglial metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a major receptor in mediating developmental astroglia to neuron communication. Selective in vivo inhibition of miR-128-3p in FMRP-deficient astroglia sufficiently rescues decreased mGluR5 function, while astroglial overexpression of miR-128-3p strongly and selectively diminishes developmental astroglial mGluR5 signaling. Subsequent transcriptome and proteome profiling further suggests that FMRP commonly and preferentially regulates protein expression through posttranscriptional, but not transcriptional, mechanisms in astroglia. Overall, our study defines an FMRP-dependent cell-autonomous miR pathway that selectively alters developmental astroglial mGluR5 signaling, unveiling astroglial molecular mechanisms involved in FXS pathogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE157723	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA662567	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA662567	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP281862	"[Overal design]examine the genome-wide mRNA expression profiles in cortical astroglia in Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y mice; [Treatment]'N/A'; [Growth]'N/A'; [Extraction]""Ribosome-bound RNAs were isolated as described previously (\u200b47\u200b).

The understanding of EJC-bound mRNA degradation before steady-state translation has been limited to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) due to a lack of suitable methodologies. Here, we show that RNA degradome data of Arabidopsis, rice, worm and human cells all exhibit a predominant accumulation of 5′ monophosphate (5′P) ends in the canonical EJC region. Inhibition of 5′-3′ exoribonuclease activity and overexpression of an EJC disassembly factor in Arabidopsis reduced the 5′P ends accumulating in the EJC region, supporting the notion that these 5′P ends are in vivo EJC footprints. Hundreds of Arabidopsis NMD targets possess evident EJC footprints, validating their degradation during the pioneer round of translation. In addition to premature termination codons, plant microRNAs can also direct the degradation of EJC-bound mRNAs. However, the production of EJC footprints from NMD but not microRNA targets is dependent on an NMD factor, SMG7.

The PIC component eukaryotic initiation factor 1A (EIF1A), encoded on human chromosomes X and Y by EIF1AX and EIF1AY, respectively, is essential for recruitment of the ternary complex and for assembling the 43S PIC, which after recruitment onto capped mRNAs scans their 5’UTR and localizes the AUG to initiate translation. Recurrent EIF1AX mutations are found in several cancers, including ~1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other drivers (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions). They are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers (11%) where they display a striking co-occurrence with RAS, which we show cooperate to induce tumorigenesis in mouse models and in isogenic cell lines. The C-terminal tail EIF1AX-A113splice mutation is the most prevalent in advanced thyroid cancer, and private to this disease. We found that EIF1AX-A113spl variants stabilize the PIC and induces ATF4 expression, a sensor of cellular stress, which is co-opted to suppress EIF-2α phosphorylation, thus enabling a general increase in protein synthetic rate. RAS stabilizes c-MYC, an effect augmented by EIF1AX-A113spl. ATF4 and c-MYC induce expression of aminoacid transporters, and enhance sensitivity of mTOR to aminoacid supply. These mutually reinforcing events generate therapeutic vulnerabilities to MEK, BRD4 and mTOR kinase inhibitors. The RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling samples provided here were used to support the claim of increased translational efficiency of ATF4.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113695	Cancer discovery	26.37	https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-0606	{Cancer discovery (26.370): 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-0606}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA453686	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA453686	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP142722	[Overal design]Comparison of Ribosome footprints in the context of EIF1AX-splice mutated (C643) and splice reverted isogenic cell line (C643-spl- rev), three replicates of ribosome-protected RNA sequencing and three replicates of RNA-seq were used.

Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present a simple approach to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using PRO-seq with RNA-seq. In combination, these methods allow us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. We identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the coding region. CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that underlie downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP is particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142895	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa687	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkaa687}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA598734	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA598734	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP239336	[Overal design]Gene expression profiling of HEK293 cells with and without specific miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing, in duplicate or triplicate, using Illumina NextSeq500.; [Treatment]'The cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors with or without miRNA expression cassette.

GSE119615	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Translation of upstream open reading frames in a model of neuronal differentiation	2018-09-06	Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiate translation within mRNA 5’ leaders,and have the potential to altermain coding sequence(CDS) translationontranscripts in which they reside. Ribosome profiling(RP)studies suggest that translating ribosomes are pervasive within 5’ leadersacross model systems. However, the significance of this observationremains unclear. To explore a role for uORF usage in neuronal differentiation, we performed RP on undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. Using a spectral coherence algorithm (SPECtre),we identify4,954uORFsacross31%of all neuroblastoma transcripts. These uORFspredominantly utilize non-AUG initiationcodonsand exhibit translational efficiencies(TE)comparable to annotated coding regions. Usage of both AUG initiated uORFs and aconservedandconsistently translated subset of non-AUG initiated uORFs correlateswith repressed CDS translation. Ribosomal protein transcripts are enriched in uORFs, and select uORFs on such transcripts were validated for expression. Withneuronal differentiation, we observedan overall positive correlation between translational shifts in uORF/CDSpairs. However,a subset of transcripts exhibit inverse shifts in translation of uORF/CDSpairs. TheseuORFsare enriched in AUG initiation sites, non-overlapping, and shorterin length. Cumulatively, CDSs downstream of uORFs characterized by persistent translation show smaller shifts in TE withneuronal differentiation relative to CDSs without a predicted uORF, suggesting that fluctuations in CDS translation are buffered by uORF translation. In sum, this work provides insights into the dynamic relationshipsand potential regulatory functionsof uORF/CDS pairs in a model of neuronal differentiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119615	BMC genomics	3.501	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5775-1	{BMC genomics (3.501): 10.1186/s12864-019-5775-1}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA489713	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA489713	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP159962	[Overal design]Examination of upstream open reading frame dependent translation regulation across non-differentiated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells; [Treatment]'SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated for 6 days in 10μM retinoic acid (all-trans, Sigma), with media changed every 24 hours.'; [Growth]'SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM:F12 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, .01mg mL-1Gentamicin and .25ug mL-1 Amphoreticin B.

GSE102315	Homo sapiens	20	Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Nutritional control of protein translation	2017-08-07	Regulation of protein translation is a key feature of many biological processes. Global protein translation as well as translation at the codon level can be regulated by RNA modifications. These modifications are particularly enriched in tRNAs, where they represent an additional regulatory layer on top of the primary RNA sequence. In eukaryotes, levels of tRNA queuosinylation reflect the bioavailability of the precursor queuine, which is salvaged from the gut microbiota and absorbed in the intestine. We show here that reduced queuine supply results in a strong reduction of tRNA queuosinylation in various cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. In addition, Dnmt2-dependent tRNA methylation is dynamically modulated by the presence or absence of queuine. Ribosome profiling showed that nutritionally determined queuosine-tRNA (Q-tRNA) levels control the translation speed of Q-tRNA decoded codons. Dysregulation of translation resulted in pronounced endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, which could be rescued by the addition of queuine. Together, these findings establish a direct link between nutrient availability and the decoding of the transcriptome, thus providing a new perspective in our understanding of translational regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102315	The EMBO journal	11.227	https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201899777	{The EMBO journal (11.227): 10.15252/embj.201899777}	'cytoplasmic RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA397422	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA397422	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP114965	"[Overal design]Cytoplasmic RNA and Cytoplasmic RNA protected by ribosome from RNase I (Ribonuclease I) cleavage, were sequenced.

Yet, the importance of this codon bias on regulating cell state-specific expression programs is currently debated. Here, we asked whether the gene expression program in the well-defined cell states of self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells is driven by optimized codon usage. Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identified distinct codon signatures for human self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. One driver for the cell state-specific codon bias was the genomic GC-content of the differentially expressed genes and thus, determined by transcription rather than translation. However, by measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome’s active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we discovered that the wobble position tRNA modification inosine strongly influenced the codon optimization in self-renewing embryonic stem cells. This effect was conserved in mice and independent of the differentiation stimulus. In summary, we newly reveal how translational mechanisms based on RNA modifications can shape optimized codon usage in embryonic stem cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123608	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1726-z	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-019-1726-z}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA509375	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA509375	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP173268	[Overal design]tRNA sequencing of self-renewing and differentiating human H9 cells, 4 biological replicates per condition; [Treatment]'Differentiating hESC were cultured in MEF-conditioned KSR media plus 1uM retinoic acid in DMSO, while the control hESC population was maintained in MEF-conditioned KSR media completed with 4 ng/mL FGF2.

GSE77033	Homo sapiens	1	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	nanoCAGE reveals 5’ UTR features that define specific modes of translation of functionally related mTOR-sensitive mRNAs	2016-01-20	mTOR regulates mRNA translation. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine [5’TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. Transcription start site profiling by Nano-Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that many mTOR-sensitive mRNAs do not have 5’TOP motifs. Moreover, nanoCAGE showed that 5’ UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of mTOR-sensitive mRNAs: i) those with short 5’ UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions such as respiration, that are translated in an eIF4E, but not eIF4A1-dependent manner and ii) mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, that harbor long 5’ UTRs, and require both eIF4E and eIF4A1 for their efficient translation. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5’ UTRs via suppression of eIF4A leads to uncoupling of expression of proteins involved in respiration (e.g. ATP5O) from those protecting mitochondrial integrity (e.g. BCL-2) ultimately resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous translational downregulation of both long and short 5’ UTR mRNAs by mTOR inhibitors results in suppression of mitochondrial respiration and predominantly cytostatic effects. Therefore, 5’ UTR features define differential modes of translation of functionally distinct mTOR-sensitive mRNAs, which explains discrepancies between the effects of mTOR and eIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77033	Genome research	9.944	https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.197566.115	{Genome research (9.944): 10.1101/gr.197566.115}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA309302	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA309302	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP068675	[Overal design]Determination of 5'UTR lengths using nanoCAGE in MCF7 cells; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'MCF7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Wisent, St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Wisent) and 1% L-Glutamine (Wisent).'; [Extraction]'Total RNA was extracted using Trizol'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: MCF7; '

GSE156749	Mus musculus	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL21493	Upregulation of 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation upon loss of the tumor suppressor ARF	2020-08-24	Tumor cells require nominal increases in protein synthesis in order to maintain high proliferation rates. As such, tumor cells must acquire enhanced ribosome production. How many of the mutations in tumor cells ultimately achieve this aberrant production is largely unknown. The gene encoding ARF is the most commonly deleted gene in human cancer. ARF plays a significant role in regulating ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing, ribosome export into the cytoplasm, and global protein synthesis. Utilizing ribosome profiling, we show that 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation is upregulated following loss of ARF. Genes with increased translational efficiency following loss of ARF include many ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Knockout of p53 largely phenocopies ARF loss, with increased protein synthesis and expression of 5’-TOP encoded proteins. The 5’-TOP regulators eIF4G1 and LARP1 are upregulated in ARF and p53 null cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156749	Scientific reports	4.011	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79379-8	{Scientific reports (4.011): 10.1038/s41598-020-79379-8}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA658965	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA658965	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP278615	[Overal design]RNAseq and Ribosome profiling for three conditions with two replicates for each.; [Treatment]'Transduced with lentiviral shRNA (shARF or shSCR)'; [Growth]'MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine (Hyclone), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Hyclone), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Hyclone), and 2 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen)'; [Extraction]'RNA was extracted by Trizol and purified using the Zymo Research Direct-Zol RNA Cleanup kit.

GSE57336	Trypanosoma brucei	22	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL10599	Stage-specific regulation of translation revealed by ribosome profiling of Trypanosoma brucei	2014-05-06	Trypanosoma brucei subspecies infect humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa. This early diverging eukaryote shows many novel features in basic biological processes, including the use of polycistronic transcription to generate all protein-coding mRNAs. Therefore we hypothesized that translational control provides a means to tune gene expression during parasite development in mammalian and fly hosts. We used ribosome profiling to examine genome-wide protein production in animal-derived slender bloodstream forms and cultured procyclic (insect midgut) forms. About one-third of all CDSs showed statistically significant regulation of protein production between the two stages. Of these, more than two-thirds showed a change in translation efficiency, but few were controlled by this parameter alone. Ribosomal proteins were translated poorly, especially in animal-derived parasites. A disproportionate number of metabolic enzymes were up-regulated at the mRNA level in procyclic forms, as were variant surface glycoproteins in bloodstream forms. Comparison with cultured bloodstream forms from another strain identified stage-specific changes in protein production that transcend strain and growth conditions. Genes with upstream ORFs had a lower mean translation efficiency but no evidence was seen for involvement of these ORFs in stage-regulation. Ribosome profiling revealed that differences in the production of specific proteins in T. brucei slender bloodstream and procyclic forms are more common than anticipated from analysis of mRNA abundance. While in vivo and in vitro derived slender bloodstream forms of different strains are more similar to one another than to procyclic forms, they showed numerous differences at both the mRNA and protein production level.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57336	BMC genomics	3.501	https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-911	{BMC genomics (3.501): 10.1186/1471-2164-15-911}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA246300	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA246300	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP041705	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and mRNA libraries were constructed in triplicate from in vitro PCF and in vivo BF lifestages of theT. brucei Treu927 and in vitro T. brucei Lister427, to evaluate role of translational gene regulation; [Treatment]'Cells were treated with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide for 2 min at either room temperature (procylic cells) or 37° (bloodform cells) to arrest elongating ribosomes.'; [Growth]'In vivo T brucei TREU927 were grown in irradiated Wistar rats infected with 107-108 parasites.  The parasites were harvested on day 3 at a parasitemia of 4´107-1.2´108 cells/ml.  In vitro procyclic TREU927 cell were grown in SDM-79 to a cell density of 5´106-1.2´107 cells/ml.  In vitro bloodform Lister427 was grown in HMI-9 to a density of 8´105 to 1.5´106 cells/ml.'; [Extraction]'For in vivo blood form parasites, the blood from 2-3 infects rats was pooled and centrifuged and the buffy coat extracted and placed into 20 ml HMI-9 without serum pre-warmed to 37°C.  To arrest translation, cycloheximide was added to 100 μg/ml and incubated for 2 minutes at 37°.  To rapidly chill the cells, 300 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline with glucose (PSG) was added and the cells were pelleted at 4°.  Only parasite populations with greater than 99% slender cells were used.  In vitro grown parasites were pelleted at 5000g and resuspended in 50 mls of media lacking serum.  Cycloheximide was added to 100 mg/ml at the cell incubated for 2min at room temperature (procyclic cells) or 37° (bloodform cells). Following cycloheximide treatment the cells were rapidly chilled with PSG and pelleted at 5000g.  Lysates from both type of parasite pellets were then prepared as following. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 plus protease inhibitors to approximately 1.3x109/ml.  Approximately one-third of the sample was placed into TRIzol (Life Technologies) for RNA extraction following manufacturer’s suggested protocol.  To the remainder, one-sixth volume of buffer A containing 0.2M sucrose and 1.2% Triton N-101 was added and the samples were dounced (30 strokes in a chilled homogenizer). After transfer to a prechilled microfuge tube, the samples were clarified by centrifugation in a microfuge at 15000 rpm for one minute.  The supernatant was withdrawn, pooled if needed, and then aliquots flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70°C.\nAfter thawing on ice, RNase I (Ambion) was added at 30 units/OD260 of lysate.  Samples were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.  RNase digestion was stopped by adding 400 units RNasin (Promega).  Samples were them layered over a 1 ml 1M sucrose cushion prepared in buffer A and ribosomes were pelleted by centrifuging for 4 hours at 70,000g in an SW55 rotor.  After removing the supernatant, the ribosomal pellet was resuspended in 500 μl buffer A with the MgCl2 replaced with 10 mM EDTA to dissociate the ribosomes and deplete larger rRNA fragments.  The protected fragments were then separated from contaminating ribosomal RNA by passage through an Amicon Ultra-4 or YM-100 column with 100,000 MW cutoff. After more than 400 μl had flowed through the membrane the RNA in the flow-through was extracted with phenol:CHCl3:iAA and the RNA precipitated.  Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using Dynabeads mRNA Direct (Life Technologies).  RNA was fragmented as described Ingolia et all 2011.  Ribosomal protected fragments between 28 and 31 nucleotides and fragmented Poly(A)+ RNA between 30 and 70 nucleotides was isolated from 15% accrylimide gels and libraries prepared for sequencing.  For detailed protocol on generating sequencing libraries for both the ribosome protected and fragmented mRNA library see Ingolia et a 2011.  Briefly, following dephosphorylation the adapter Linker-1 (IDT) was ligated to the 3’ end of the fragment and the ligated product gel purified.  The adapter was used for priming reverse.  Following gel purification the cDNA was circularized with Circ Ligase (Epicenter Biotechnologies).  Circles containing ribosomal RNA were subtracted using biotinylated primers .  The final library was generated by PCR..To map the 5’ end of the transcripts, libraries enriched for the 5’ ends of mRNAs were constructed from three biological samples of strain 927 (2 PCF and 1 slBF selected from the biological samples above).  SL libraries were constructed as described Mittra B et al 2013.  In brief, RNA was prepared and cDNA synthesized using primer ending in a random 6 bases.

GSE77180	Homo sapiens	8	Expression profiling by array	GPL5175	Translational reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells induced by 5-fluorouracil through a miRNA-dependent mechanism	2016-01-25	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in colorectal cancer. Previous studies showed that 5-FU modulates RNA metabolism and mRNA expression. In addition, it has been reported that 5-FU incorporates into the RNAs constituting the translational machinery and that 5-FU affects the amount of some mRNAs associated with ribosomes. However, the impact of 5-FU on translational regulation remains unclear. Using translatome profiling, we report that a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU induces a translational reprogramming in colorectal cancer cell lines. Comparison of mRNA distribution between polysomal and non-polysomal fractions in response to 5-FU treatment using microarray quantification identified 313 genes whose translation was selectively regulated. These regulations were mostly stimulatory (91%). Among these genes, we showed that 5-FU increases the mRNA translation of HIVEP2, which encodes a transcription factor whose translation in normal condition is known to be inhibited by mir-155. In response to 5-FU, the expression of mir-155 decreases thus stimulating the translation of HIVEP2 mRNA. Interestingly, the 5-FU-induced increase in specific mRNA translation was associated with reduction of global protein synthesis. Altogether, these findings indicate that 5-FU promotes a translational reprogramming leading to the increased translation of a subset of mRNAs that involves at least for some of them, miRNA-dependent mechanisms. This study supports a still poorly evaluated role of translational control in drug response.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77180	Oncotarget	None	https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.17597	{Oncotarget (None): 10.18632/oncotarget.17597}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA309671	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA309671	None	"[Overal design]8 total samples were analyzed.

In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced usage of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells, but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132007	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.129	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.129}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA545625	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA545625	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP199985	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling (and complementary RNA-sequencing) was performed in HCT116 cells that received, via lentivirus, Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting either EIF5A, DOHH or non-targeting control sgRNAs.

GSE166874	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Ribosome profiling reveals sequence-independent post-initiation pausing as a signature of translation	2021-02-16	The journey of a newly synthesized polypeptide starts in the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome, from where it traverses the exit tunnel. The interior of the ribosome exit tunnel is neither straight nor smooth. How the ribosome dynamics in vivo is influenced by the exit tunnel is poorly understood. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in mammalian cells reveals elevated ribosome density at the start codon and surprisingly the downstream 5th codon position as well. We found that the highly focused ribosomal pausing shortly after initiation is attributed to the geometry of the exit tunnel, as deletion of the loop region from ribosome protein L4 diminishes translational pausing at the 5th codon position. Unexpectedly, the ribosome variant undergoes translational abandonment shortly after initiation, suggesting that there exists an obligatory step between initiation and elongation commitment. We propose that the post-initiation pausing of ribosomes represents an inherent signature of the translation machinery to ensure productive translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE166874	Cell research	17.848	https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2014.74	{Cell research (17.848): 10.1038/cr.2014.74}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA702160	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA702160	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP306724	"[Overal design]We performed Ribo-seq in wildtype HEK293 cells and the cells expressed with mutated RPL4.; [Treatment]'HEK293 stable cell lines expressing GFP control, L4 wild type, or Δloop mutant were infected with lentiviruses encoding shRNA targeting RPL4 or scramble control.'; [Growth]""HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).""; [Extraction]""Sucrose solutions were prepared in polysome gradient buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/ml CHX, 5 mM DTT, and 20 U/ml SUPERase_In (Ambion)).

The mechanism of anemia involves an impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis of erythroblasts. Here we show that GATA1 protein expression is low in line with a defect in the representation of its mRNA at the ribosome. A global analysis of transcripts on polysomes indicates that translation is selective with a decreased representation of the transcripts with a short coding sequence and UTRs and a highly structured 3’UTR, a subset of transcripts that includes GATA1. Our whole proteome analysis confirms that post-transcriptionally downregulated proteins were encoded by transcripts with a short length and structured 3’UTR. We identified a subset of post-translationally downregulated proteins including ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors encoded by 5’TOP mRNAs that were enriched on the ribosome. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic characteristics of 3’UTR and in a lesser extend 5’UTR and the transcript length are the determinants of translation selectivity under RPS14 haploinsufficiency conditions and that a post-translational regulation of ribosomal proteins accounts for their decreased content in the cell.

GSE51584	Homo sapiens	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL9115; GPL11154	Expanded identification and characterization of mammalian circular RNAs	2013-10-23	The recent reports of two circular RNAs (circRNAs) with strong potential to act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges suggest that circRNAs might play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the global properties of circRNAs are not well understood. We developed a computational pipeline to identify circRNAs and quantify their relative abundance from RNA-seq data. Applying this pipeline to a large set of non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project, we annotated 7,112 human circRNAs that were estimated to comprise at least 10% of the transcripts accumulating from their loci. Most circRNAs are expressed in only a few cell types and at low abundance, but they are no more cell-type–specific than are mRNAs with similar overall expression levels. Although most circRNAs overlap protein-coding sequences, ribosome profiling provides no evidence for their translation. We also annotated 635 mouse circRNAs, and although 20% of them are orthologous to human circRNAs, the sequence conservation of these circRNA orthologs is no higher than that of their flanking linear exons. The previously proposed miR-7 sponge, CDR1as, is one of only two circRNAs with more miRNA sites than expected by chance, with the next best miRNA-sponge candidate deriving from a primate-specific zinc-finger gene, ZNF91. These results provide a new framework for future investigation of this intriguing topological isoform while raising doubts regarding a biological function of most circRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51584	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0409-z	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-014-0409-z}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA223608	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA223608	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP031849	"[Overal design]Examination of 9 samples in 1 cell type Note: The ENCODE data we used are under GEO SuperSeries GSE26284 (all samples labeled ""_cell_total"").

Differentiation is brought about by global changes to chromatin architecture and transcriptional networks, yet whether other regulatory events support cell fate determination is less well understood. Using human embryonic stem cell and Xenopus models, we identified the vertebrate-specific ubiquitin ligase Cul3KBTBD8 as an essential regulator of neural crest specification. Cul3KBTBD8 monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralog TCOF1, whose mutation underlies the craniofacial disorder Treacher Collins Syndrome that is characterized by a loss of cranial neural crest cells. Ubiquitylation of NOLC1 and TCOF1 drives formation of a platform that connects RNA polymerase I with ribosome modification enzymes, thereby altering the translational program of differentiating cells to support the generation of neural crest cells. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of ribosome function is an important feature of cell fate determination.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62247	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14978	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature14978}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA263582	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA263582	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP048825	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and mRNA-Seq; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'feeder-free in mTESR1', 'neural conversion with NIM for 1d', 'neural conversion with NIM for 3d', 'neural conversion with NIM for 6d'; [Extraction]'RNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification'; [Cell type]'Source: ''treatment: lentiviral infection with sh control; cell line: H1; extract_protocol: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction; ', 'treatment: lentiviral infection with sh KBTBD8; cell line: H1; extract_protocol: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction; ', 'treatment: lentiviral infection with sh control; cell line: H1; extract_protocol: Standard mRNA-seq; ', 'treatment: lentiviral infection with sh KBTBD8; cell line: H1; extract_protocol: Standard mRNA-seq; ', 'treatment: lentiviral infection with sh TCOF1; cell line: H1; extract_protocol: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction; ', 'treatment: lentiviral infection with sh TCOF1; cell line: H1; extract_protocol: Standard mRNA-seq; '

Despite miRNAs’ crucial role in various cellular processes and disease states, the identification of their targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are inadequate in differentiating direct targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we introduce a simple approach involving combined analysis of RNA-seq and Precise RunOn-seq (PRO-seq) (CARP) to effectively measure post-transcriptional regulation. We apply this approach to seven different miRNAs and robustly distinguish their direct targets from downstream changes. We validate the efficacy of our approach using argonaute-CLIP-seq. We show using CARP and ribosome-profiling analyses that accelerated mRNA decay is the major mode of target regulation by miRNAs. Additionally, our comparative analyses reveal that CARP aids in discovery of complex regulatory mechanisms and in capturing false-negatives of existing approaches. Furthermore, post-transcriptional changes measured using CARP uncover miRNA-dependent regulation of coding sites. Lastly, we demonstrate that PRO-seq provides mechanistic explanation of indirect targeting, unraveling miRNA regulatory networks. Finally, we believe that CARP is particularly suitable to study in vivo functions of miRNAs in primary cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140366	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa687	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkaa687}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA589466	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA589466	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP229759	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of HEK293 cells with and without specific miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina NextSeq500; [Treatment]'The cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors with or without miRNA expression cassette.

We used oligo (dT)-selected polyA+ RNA to construct libraries for RNA-Seq.We then profiled the transcriptome of polyadenylated mRNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing platforms. We then used the sequenced reads to reconstruct the transcriptome using the Cufflinks de-novo assembler (Trapnell et al. Nat.Bio.Tech. 2010). Recent computational and ribosome profiling analyses suggest that many short open reading frames (sORFs) in eukaryotic genomes are translated. However, evidence that these sORFs produce stable polypeptides is lacking. Here we develop a strategy to discover and validate novel sORF-encoded polypeptides (SEPs) in human cells. In total, we detect 117 SEPs, 114 of which are novel, varying in length from 15 to 149 amino acids. Of these, 10 SEPs (0.5%) are derived from long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). We also observe the presence of polycistronic genes and the widespread use of non-AUG start codons, which is a phenomenon historically thought to be rare in the mammalian genome. Quantitative measurements reveal that SEPs can be found at concentrations between ~10-2000 copies per cell, which is within the range of typical cellular proteins. We confirm the translation of a number of these SEPs through heterologous expression of their encoding cDNAs. We also discover that several SEPs possess properties characteristic of functional proteins.

Intersection of these analyses showed that BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate (F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced glycolytic capacity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158669	Oncogene	6.634	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-021-01702-y	{Oncogene (6.634): 10.1038/s41388-021-01702-y}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA666167	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA666167	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP285644	[Overal design]We performed combined RNA-Seq, miRNA-seq, and ribosome profiling in shBCDIN3D MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; [Treatment]'No treatment - collected 48h after seeding at 10^5 cells/mL', '24h with 10nM Rapamycin - collected 48h after seeding at 10^5 cells/mL'; [Growth]'DMEM+10%FBS+PSQ+1µg/mL puromycin'; [Extraction]'As in Ingolia at al, 2012\nAs in Ingolia at al, 2012', 'Norgen RNA/protein purification kit\nTruSeq Stranded Total RNA', 'Norgen RNA/protein purification kit followed by gel extraction of small RNAs < 35 nt\nAs in Ingolia at al, 2012'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: MDA-MB-231; shRNA status: shNC; molecule type: ribosome-protected RNA; ', 'cell line: MDA-MB-231; shRNA status: shBCDIN3D; molecule type: ribosome-protected RNA; ', 'cell line: MDA-MB-231; shRNA status: shNC; molecule type: total RNA; ', 'cell line: MDA-MB-231; shRNA status: shBCDIN3D; molecule type: total RNA; ', 'cell line: MDA-MB-231; shRNA status: shNC; molecule type: Gel-fractionated small RNA; ', 'cell line: MDA-MB-231; shRNA status: shBCDIN3D; molecule type: Gel-fractionated small RNA; '

The results indicated that ribosome proteins were overwhelmingly up-regulated in the Myc-induced liver tumors. Cross-species analyses showed that the zebrafish Myc model correlated well with Myc transgenic mouse models for liver cancers. The Myc-induced zebrafish liver tumors also possessed molecular signatures highly similar to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

In contrast to previous reports based on studies of human cancer cell lines, almost all methylation sites were close to fully methylated in adult tissues. A subset of sites was differentially modified in developing tissues compared to their adult counterparts and showed clear developmental dynamics. This provides the first evidence for ribosome heterogeneity at the level of rRNA modifications during mouse development. In a prominent example, the expression levels of SNORD78 during development appeared to be regulated by alternative splicing of the Gas5 host-gene and to correlate with the methylation level of its target site at LSU-G4593.

Method: Here we describe a novel interplay between RBPsLIN28B and IMP1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Ribosome-profiling and RNA-sequencing identifies IMP1 as a principle nodefor gene expression regulation downstream of LIN28B. Results: In vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that epithelial IMP1 loss increases expression of WNT target genes and enhances LIN28B-mediated intestinal tumorigenesis, which was reversed when we overexpressed IMP1 independently in vivo. Furthermore, IMP1 loss in wild type or LIN28B-overexpressing mice enhancesthe regenerative response to irradiation. Conclusions: Together, our data provide new evidence for the opposing effects of the LIN28B-IMP1 axis on post-transcriptional regulation of canonical WNT signaling, with implications in intestinal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE115647	Genes & development	8.99	https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.314369.118	{Genes & development (8.990): 10.1101/gad.314369.118}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA475675	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA475675	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP150308	[Overal design]Ribosome-footprinting and RNA-seq samples from LIN28B OE SW480 cells and LIN28B OE+IMP1-/- knockout cells; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Ribosome profiling libraries from 3 pooled cell culture plates were prepared using a standard protocol (McGlincy and Ingolia, Methods 2017), with minor modifications.\nSeparate 5’ and 3’ linkers were ligated to the RNA-fragment instead of 3’ linker followed by circularization (Subtelny et al, Nature 2014). 5’ linkers contained 4 random nt unique molecular identifier (UMI) similar to a 5 nt UMI in 3’ linkers.

Using total RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, we have characterized the transcriptional and translational scope of B cells infected with EBV. We could show that viral transcripts are translated at variable efficiency and that several viral genes show ribosome recruitment to the 5’ leader region of mRNAs. We used two different virus strains with differing in vitro characteristics to study EBV translation and could show that in cells infected with the weakly replicating EBV strain some lytic genes showed evidence of monosomal ribosome recruitment mainly in the 5’ leader region and on start codons in the absence of protein production.

We performed an unbiased next-generation RNA-sequencing approach to identify commonalities or differences of the effect of HIV, HCV and HBV viremia on NK cell transcriptomes. Methods: Using cell sorting, we obtained CD3-CD56+ NK cells from blood of 6 HIV, 11 HCV, and 32 HBV infected and untreated patients. Library preparation and sequencing were done using Illumina mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit and the HiSeq 2000, HiSeq2500 or NextSeq 500, and further analysis by an in-house analytic pipeline. Results: In NK cells from HIV, HCV and HBV patients, transcriptome analysis identified 272, 53, and 56 differentially expressed genes, respectively (fold change >1.5, q-value 0.2). Interferon stimulated genes were induced in NK cells from HIV/HCV patients, but not during HBV infection. HIV viremia downregulated ribosome assembly genes in NK cells. In HBV, viral load and ALT variation had little effect on genes related to NK effector function. Conclusion: We compare, for the first time, NK cell transcripts of viremic HIV, HCV and HBV patients. We clearly demonstrate distinctive NK cell gene signatures in 3 different populations, suggestive for a different degree of functional alterations of the NK cell compartment as compared to healthy individuals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE125686	Journal of virology	4.324	https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00575-18	{Journal of virology (4.324): 10.1128/JVI.00575-18}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA517165	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA517165	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP182096	"[Overal design]We analyzed NK cell transcripts collected from the blood of well-characterized chronic HBV patients (n=32), chronic HCV patients (n=8), and HIV patients (n=6).

Studies of the genetic forms of PD have helped to reveal disease mechanisms. Functional interactions between some Parkinson's disease (PD) genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions between VPS35, EIF4G1 and alpha-synuclein, a protein with a key role in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD. We extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show these interactions are conserved in neurons. We also connect VPS35 impairments to neurodegeneration in alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Our studies reveal unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated PD genes and functionally connect them to alpha-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, worms, and mouse. Finally, we provide a resource of candidate PD genes for future genetic and functional interrogation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64304	Neuron	14.403	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.11.027	{Neuron (14.403): 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.11.027}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA270712	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA270712	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP051314	"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) of wild type and VPS35 deletion yeast strains, with or without overexpression of the TIF4631 initiation factor; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Yeast were grown in synthetic defined media to early-log phase.

Intriguingly, however, a cancer-related DDX3 variant DDX3 R534H selectively preserves translation of genes encoding core nucleosome components. Additionally, DDX3 variants also shift ORF usage on select genes, such as RPLP1 and stress-response factors as an added mechanism of translation regulation during stress. Thus, DDX3 through both extensive and selective interactions with RNA and the ribosomal machinery helps to remodel the translational landscape under stress and in cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70802	Oncotarget	None	https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.8612	{Oncotarget (None): 10.18632/oncotarget.8612}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA289569	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA289569	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP060676	[Overal design]Cells expressing either DDX3 WT or R534H variant were treated with or without sodium arsenite and lysed in the presence of cyclohexime.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71898	Molecular cancer therapeutics	4.856	https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414	{Molecular cancer therapeutics (4.856): 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292421	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292421	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP062229	[Overal design]Profiles of MCF7 and HCT116 Akti-1/2 treated cells and MCF7 and HCT116 vehicle (i.e. DMSO) treated cells were generated, each in duplicate, using GRO-Seq.; [Treatment]'Cells were treated for 72h with vehicle (DMSO), Akti-1/2 inhibitor (HCT116: 20µM; MCF7: 2µM) (Sigma)'; [Growth]'MCF7 was maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 40mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin; HCT116 was maintained in McCoy’s 5α medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin.

Here we simulate the translational deregulation found in cancer by ectopically over expressing translation initiation factor eIF4E in primary human mammary epithelial cells; and examine its impact on cell biology and the pattern of ribosomal recruitment to mRNA genome wide. Over expression of eIF4E allows cells to bypass M0 premature growth arrest, but does not confer other malignant properties. However, in concert with hTERT, eIF4E imparts cells with growth and survival autonomy - and profoundly alters the pattern of polyribosome-associated mRNA encoding cell cycle and apoptosis regulators. The translational response to increased eIF4E is not only a unidirectional activation of oncogenic drivers, but also consists of complex intrinsic translational mechanisms that mitigate the acquisition of neoplastic properties.

GSE134865	Homo sapiens	12	Other	GPL18573	Transcriptome-wide analysis of RNA structure in MCF7 cells with and without inhibition of eIF4A by hippuristanol treatment	2019-07-25	Translational dysregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancer, and increased activity of the mRNA helicase eIF4A is associated with poor survival in malignancies. This is believed to be due to the unwinding of secondary structures within the 5’UTRs of oncogenic mRNAs, with studies showing that in general eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have longer 5’UTRs with more stable secondary structures, yet our ability to predict eIF4A-dependency from 5’UTR properties alone remains poor. We therefore used Structure-seq 2 to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA structure in MCF7 cells, following eIF4A inhibition with hippuristanol. This technique measures the single-strandedness of RNA by specific and rapid methylation of single-stranded adenosines and cytosines with Dimethyl Sulphate (DMS). When paired with polysome profiling data to identify which mRNAs are most translationally repressed, we can identify the structural determinants of eIF4A-dependency. Upon eIF4A inhibition, both 5’UTRs and CDSs become generally more structured, while overall this was not observed for 3’UTRs. This was most pronounced in CDSs, supporting recent findings that the ribosome sculpts RNA structure in this region. 5’UTRs are generally more structured at their 5’ ends and highly translated mRNAs are less structured just upstream of the CDS. Following eIF4A inhibition, the 5’UTR is remodelled. eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have greater localised gains of structure. The degree of these structural changes is strongly correlated with 5’UTR length, explaining why eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have longer 5’UTRs. Crucially, in eIF4A-dependent mRNAs these highly-structured elements are located predominantly at the 3’ end of the 5’UTR, suggesting that increased structure just upstream of the CDS is most inhibitory to translation following eIF4A inhibition and is a key determinant of eIF4A-dependency.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134865	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1901-2	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-019-1901-2}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA556678	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA556678	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP216397	"[Overal design]MCF7 cells were treated with and without dimethyl sulphate (DMS) following treatment with and without hippuristanol in triplicate.

Poly(A) RNA was dissolved in 17 µl TE (10mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1mM EDTA). 1 µl was used to run on Bioanalyzer with the mRNA Nano assay to confirm removal of rRNA and 1 µl was used to determine RNA concentration with a nanodrop. The remaining 15 µl (typically slightly more than 1µg) was used in the following reverse transcription step. For each sample, 1 µg of poly(A) RNA was diluted to 15 µl and mixed with 2 µl of the N6 linker oligo: 5’CAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCNNNNNN3’ (100 µM) and 3 µl KCl (1M) and split between 2 x 10 µl. RNA was denatured in a thermal cycler at 90°C for 1 min before rapidly cooling to 4°C and held for 1 min. Temperature was increased to 25°C and 4 µl 5X buffer (100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 25mM MgCl2, 25mM DTT, 2.5mM dNTPs), 5 µl nuclease free water and 1 µl SuperScript III (200U/µl) (Thermo Fisher 18080085) was added to each 10 µl sample. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 25°C to promote annealing and to allow slight extension of RT primers, followed by 5 min at 42°C for further extension and finally 55°C for 50 min for full extension. Samples were then heated at 85°C for 5 min to denature the enzyme, followed by addition of 2 µl NaOH (1M) and incubation at 95°C for 10 min to hydrolyse the RNA. Samples were purified by gel extraction with an 8% polyacrylamide, 1mm thick denaturing gel. To ensure maximal removal of the N6 linker, which can form an unwanted byproduct if not removed, cDNA running above an N78 ssDNA oligo was purified, which should run 50nt higher than the N6 linker. cDNA was dissolved in 5.5 µl Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To the 5.5 µl cDNA was added 0.5 µl hairpin donor oligo /5Phos/TGAAGAGCCTAGTCGCTGTTCANNNNNNCTGCCCATAGAG/3SpC3/ (400 µM), 2 µl betaine (5M) and 8 µl 50% PEG 8000 (added last and at room temperature to avoid precipitating DNA). Samples were heated at 95°C for 90sec and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. 2 µl 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer and 2 µl T4 DNA ligase (400U/µl) (NEB M0202S) were added and the samples were incubated at 16°C for 6h followed by 30°C for 6h and then 65°C for 10 min to denature the enzyme. Samples were purified by gel extraction with a 6% polyacrylamide, 1mm thick denaturing gel and cDNA running above an N118 ssDNA oligo was purified; this oligo should run 50nt above any ligated N6 linker. Ligated cDNA was dissolved in 18 µl Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To determine the number of PCR cycles required, 25 µl reactions were set up with 5 µl taken from the samples at cycles 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23 and the amplified DNA was run on a 5% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Reactions were set up with 5 µl 1X Q5 buffer, 5 µl GC rich enhancer buffer, 0.5 µl dNTPs (10mM each), 0.25 µl Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (2000U/ml) (NEB M0493L), 1 µl Truseq forward primer: 5’AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTTGAACAGCGACTAGGCTCTTCA3’ (10 µM), 1 µl relevant Truseq reverse primer: 5’CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATBARCODEGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC3’ (10 µM), 4.5 µl ligated cDNA and 7.75 water. Reactions were activated at 98°C for 30sec followed by cycling between 98°C for 10sec and 72°C for 45sec. It was determined that 17 cycles was optimal, as this was the first cycle where the product was visible on the gel. The remaining samples were amplified in 3 x 25 µl reactions as above, for 17 cycles plus a final extension time of 5 mins at 72°C and then combined and gel purified on a 5% polyacrylamide, 1.5mm thick denaturing gel. Resultant PCR products running between ~200-600nt, as determined with ss50 ladder (Simplex Sciences) were purified and dissolved in 20 µl Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).

GSE87888	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	4	Other	GPL13821	A novel translational control mechanism involving RNA structures within coding sequences	2016-10-12	The impact of RNA structures in coding sequences (CDS) within mRNAs is poorly understood. Here we identify a novel and highly conserved mechanism of translational control involving RNA structures within coding sequences and the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1. Using yeast genetics and genome-wide ribosome profiling analyses we show that this mechanism, initially derived from studies of the Brome Mosaic virus RNA genome, extends to yeast and human mRNAs highly enriched in membrane and secreted proteins. All Dhh1-dependent mRNAs, viral and cellular, share key common features. First, they contain long and highly structured CDSs, including a region located around nucleotide 70 after the translation initiation site, second, they are directly bound by Dhh1 with a specific binding distribution and third, complementary experimental approaches suggest that they are activated by Dhh1 at the translation initiation step. Our results show that ribosome translocation is not the only unwinding force of CDS and uncover a novel layer of translational control that involves RNA helicases and RNA folding within CDS providing novel opportunities for regulation of membrane and secretome proteins.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87888	Genome research	9.944	https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.209015.116	{Genome research (9.944): 10.1101/gr.209015.116}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA348109	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA348109	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP091450	"[Overal design]Wild-type BY4741 yeast cells or cells expressing genomically His-Tev-ProtA-tagged Dhh1 were crosslinked using UV and analysed by CRAC.; [Treatment]'Cells were crosslinked using UV (254 nm) in culturo as previously described (Bohnsack et al., 2012)'; [Growth]'Wild-type BY4741 yeast cells or yeast cells expressing Dhh1-His-Tev-ProtA from the genomic Dhh1 locus were grown in exponential phase in YPD.'; [Extraction]""Crosslinked RNA-protein complexes were purified under denaturing conditions and RNAs associated with His-ProtA-tagged proteins were trimmed (Bohnsack et al., 2012).\n3' and 5' adapters were ligated and a cDNA library was prepared by reverse transcription and amplified by PCR (Bohnsack et al., 2012).""; [Cell type]'Source: ''tag: no tag; ', 'tag: Dhh1-His-Tev-ProtA; '"
GSE138640	Homo sapiens	3	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Stop Codon Context Influences Genome-Wide Stimulation of Termination Codon Readthrough by Aminoglycosides [Dataset 3]	2019-10-09	Stop codon readthrough (SCR) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138640	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576651	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576651	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224954	[Overal design]3 ribosome profiling samples are included from HEK293T cells; [Treatment]'Aminoglycosides were added to cells, and treated for 24 hours'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS to ~75% confluency before harvest'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed on ice in the presence of cycloheximide.

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacylated tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels with specific isoacceptor patterns and a correlation with codon usage. tRNAs for isoleucine, asparagine, aspartate and arginine were lowly loaded and conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex relation between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126382	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	9.58	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1918145117	{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (9.580): 10.1073/pnas.1918145117}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA521743	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA521743	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP185476	[Overal design]Profiling of total and (aminoacyl)-tRNAs in liver of mice fed Ad libitum or fasted; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNAs were extracted from mouse liver using phenol/chloroform and miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen) under cold and acidic conditions (pH4.9).

IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and Imp1 hypomorphic mice exhibit severe gut growth defects. In the present study, we investigated the mechanistic contribution of intestinal epithelial IMP1 to gut homeostasis and response to injury. Method: We evaluated IMP1 expression in patients with Crohn’s disease followed by unbiased ribosome profiling in IMP1 knockout cells. Concurrently, we measured differences in histology and cytokine expression in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific Imp1 deletion (Imp1ΔIEC) following dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- colitis. Based on ribosome profiling analysis, we evaluated changes in autophagy in Imp1ΔIEC mice as well as in silico and in vitro approaches to evaluate direct protein:RNA interactions. Finally, we analyzed the consequence of genetic deletion of Atg7 in Imp1ΔIEC mice using colitis and irradiation models. Results: IMP1 was robustly upregulated in Crohn’s disease patients and Imp1 loss lessened DSS-colitis severity. Unbiased ribosome-profiling revealed that IMP1 may coordinate translation of multiple pathways important for intestinal homeostasis, including cell cycle and autophagy, which we verified by Western blotting. Mechanistically, we observed evidence for increased autophagy flux in Imp1ΔIEC mice, reinforced through in silico and biochemical analyses revealing direct binding of IMP1 to autophagy transcripts. Finally, we found genetic deletion of Atg7 reversed the phenotype observed in DSS- or irradiation-challenged Imp1ΔIEC mice. Conclusions: IMP1 acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of gut epithelial repair, in part through modulation of autophagy. This study highlights the need for examining post-transcriptional regulation as a critical mechanism in inflammatory bowel disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112305	EMBO reports	8.383	https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201847074	{EMBO reports (8.383): 10.15252/embr.201847074}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA445600	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA445600	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP136411	[Overal design]Ribosome-footprinting and RNA-seq samples from WT SW480 cells and IMP1-/- knockout cells; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Ribosome profiling libraries from 3 pooled cell culture plates were prepared using a standard protocol (McGlincy and Ingolia, Methods 2017), with minor modifications.\nSeparate 5’ and 3’ linkers were ligated to the RNA-fragment instead of 3’ linker followed by circularization (Subtelny et al, Nature 2014). 5’ linkers contained 4 random nt unique molecular identifier (UMI) similar to a 5 nt UMI in 3’ linkers.

It activates adaptive responses in organisms from yeast to human to rewire metabolism, remove depolarized mitochondria, and degrade unimported precursor proteins. It remains unclear how cells maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, which is critical for maintaining iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis, an indispensable function of mitochondria.

Extensive omics analyses of these mutants show that accompanying mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, these mutants progressively activate adaptive responses, including transcriptional downregulation of ATP synthase inhibitor Inh1 and OXPHOS subunits, Puf3-mediated upregulation of import receptor Mia40 and global mitochondrial biogenesis, Snf1/AMPK-mediated upregulation of glycolysis and repression of ribosome biogenesis, and transcriptional upregulation of cytoplasmic chaperones.

GSE130742	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Effect of ILF3 on translation during homeostasis and the antiviral response	2019-05-06	Upon detection of viral infections, cells activate the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines to control viral dissemination. As part of their antiviral response, cells also trigger the translational shutoff response which prevents translation of viral mRNAs and cellular mRNAs in a non-selective manner. Intriguingly, mRNAs encoding for antiviral factors bypass this translational shutoff, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms enabling expression of the self-defence genes. Here, we identified the dsRNA binding protein ILF3 as an essential host factor required for efficient translation of the central antiviral cytokine, IFNB1, and a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. By combining polysome profiling and next-generation sequencing, ILF3 was also found to be necessary to establish the dsRNA-induced transcriptional and translational programs. We propose a central role for the host factor ILF3 in enhancing expression of the antiviral defence mRNAs in cellular conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised. In this dataset we use polysome profiling in combination with RNA-seq to investigate the effect of ILF3 on the translation of mRNAs in HeLa cells in homeostasis and the antiviral response.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130742	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1060	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkz1060}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA541267	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA541267	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP195527	[Overal design]To study the effect of ILF3 on translation, HeLa cells were first depleted of ILF3 by transfection with either a pool of siRNAs that target all splice isoforms of ILF3 (siILF3) or a pool of non-targeting control (Mock) siRNAs for 72h.

GSE102040	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Base-resolution mapping reveals distinct classes of N1-methyladenosine methylome in nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded transcripts	2017-07-30	Gene expression can be post-transcriptionally regulated via dynamic and reversible RNA modifications. N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is a recently identified mRNA modification; however, little is known about its precise location, regulation and function. Here, we develop a single-nucleotide resolution m1A profiling method, based on m1A-induced misincorporation during reverse transcription, and report distinct classes of m1A methylome in the human transcriptome. m1A in the 5’-untranslated region, particularly those located exactly at the first nucleotide of mRNA transcripts, associates with increased translation efficiency. A different subset of m1A sites exhibit a GUUCRA tRNA-like motif, are evenly distributed in the transcriptome and are dependent on the methyltransferase complex TRMT6/61A. Additionally, we show for the first time that m1A is prevalent in the mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Manipulation of m1A level via TRMT61B, a mitochondria-localizing m1A methyltransferase, demonstrates that m1A in mitochondrial mRNA interferes with translation. Collectively, our approaches reveal distinct classes of m1A methylome and provide a resource for functional studies of m1A-mediated epitranscriptomic regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102040	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.10.019	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.10.019}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA396456	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA396456	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP114321	"[Overal design]We developed a method named ""m1A-MAP"" to detect m1A in both the nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial encoded transcriptome in a single-base resolution.

GSE87892	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL19958	Ribosome profiling of dhh1∆ yeast	2016-10-12	The impact of RNA structures in coding sequences (CDS) within mRNAs is poorly understood. Here we identify a novel and highly conserved mechanism of translational control involving RNA structures within coding sequences and the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1. Using yeast genetics and genome-wide ribosome profiling analyses we show that this mechanism, initially derived from studies of the Brome Mosaic virus RNA genome, extends to yeast and human mRNAs highly enriched in membrane and secreted proteins. All Dhh1-dependent mRNAs, viral and cellular, share key common features. First, they contain long and highly structured CDSs, including a region located around 42 to 120 nucleotides after the translation initiation site, second, they are directly bound by Dhh1 with a specific binding distribution and third, complementary experimental approaches suggest that they are activated by Dhh1 at the translation initiation step. Our results show that ribosome translocation is not the only unwinding force of CDS and uncover a conserved layer of translational control that involve RNA helicases and RNA folding within CDS providing novel opportunities for regulation of membrane and secretome proteins.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87892	Genome research	9.944	https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.209015.116	{Genome research (9.944): 10.1101/gr.209015.116}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA348115	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA348115	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP091454	"[Overal design]Cells were grown in rich medium and sequencing was performed on ribosome-protected footprints and matched samples of randomly fragmented polyA-enriched RNA.

We recently reported a novel human phenotype resulting from a mutation in the critical coding region of the HBS1L gene characterized by facial dysmorphism, severe growth restriction, axial hypotonia, global developmental delay and retinal pigmentary deposits. Here we further characterize downstream effects of the human HBS1L mutation. HBS1L has three transcripts in humans, and RT-PCR demonstrated reduced mRNA levels corresponding with transcripts V1 and V2 whereas V3 expression was unchanged. Western blot analyses revealed HBS1L protein was absent in proband samples. Additionally, polysome profiling revealed an abnormal aggregation of 80S monosomes in patient cells under baseline conditions. RNASeq data corresponded to the patient phenotype, with biological process analysis showing skeletal system development and sensory development genes being most altered between patient and controls. Ribosomal sequencing demonstrated an increased translation efficiency of ribosomal RNA in Hbs1L-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that there may be a compensatory increase in ribosome translation to accommodate the increased 80S monosome peak. Furthermore, lack of Hbs1L caused depletion of Pelota protein in both patient cells and mouse tissues, while PELO mRNA levels were unaffected. Inhibition of proteasomal function partially restored Pelota expression in human Hbs1L-deficient cells. We also describe a mouse model harboring a knockdown mutation in the murine Hbs1l gene that shared several of the phenotypic elements observed in the Hbs1L-deficient human including facial dysmorphism, growth restriction and retinal deposits. The Hbs1lKO mice similarly demonstrate diminished Pelota levels that were rescued by proteasome inhibition.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123564	PLoS genetics	5.224	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007917	{PLoS genetics (5.224): 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007917}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA509230	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA509230	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP173240	[Overal design]12 physical samples of cell cultures (patient and 2 healthy individuals as controls, 2-6 replicates per individual).

GSE99909	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Polysome-profiling in small tissue samples - proof of concept experiment for the use of an optimized non linear gradient	2017-06-12	Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study translatomes, i.e. transcriptome-wide patterns of translational efficiency. The standard approach for collecting efficiently translated polysome-associated RNA results in laborious extraction of RNA from a large volume across many fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts such as primary cells or frozen tissues. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for mRNAs associated with >3 ribosomes in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10 fold. The technique can be applied to frozen tissue samples from biobanks, and generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material. When coupled with smart-seq2, a single-cell RNA sequencing technique, translatomes from small tissue samples can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associated with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation to maintain protein levels constant. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in bio banks.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99909	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx940	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkx940}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA390060	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA390060	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP108979	[Overal design]We used two cell lines that differ in their p53 status (HCT-116 p53+/+ and HCT-116 p53-/-) and serum-starved them (16 h).

GSE93133	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL15456	The novel lysine specific methyltransferase METTL21B affects mRNA translation through inducible and dynamic methylation of Lys-165 in human eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A)	2017-01-04	Lysine methylation is abundant on histone proteins, representing a dynamic regulator of chromatin state and gene activity, but is also frequent on many nonhistone proteins, including eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A). However, the functional significance of eEF1Amethylation remains obscure and it has remained unclear whether eEF1A methylation is dynamic and subject to active regulation. We here demonstrate, using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase METTL21B specifically targets Lys-165 in eEF1A in an aminoacyl-tRNA- and GTP-dependent manner. Interestingly, METTL21B mediated eEF1A methylation showed strong variation across different tissues and cell lines, and was induced by altering growth conditions or by treatment with certain ER-stress-inducing drugs, concomitant with an increase in METTL21B gene expression. Moreover, genetic ablation of METTL21B function in mammalian cells caused substantial alterations in mRNA translation, as measured by ribosome profiling. A non-canonical function for eEF1A in organization of the cellular cytoskeleton has been reported, and interestingly, METTL21B accumulated in centrosomes, in addition to the expected cytosolic localization.

GSE65999	Homo sapiens	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	The contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome	2015-02-17	Alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes. Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins. We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site selectivity of ADARB1 protein products. Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65999	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0876-5	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-016-0876-5}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA275667	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA275667	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP055105	[Overal design]Comparing the A-I RNA editing levels of HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector (CV) control, Alu exon inclusion (long) isoform of ADARB1, and Alu exon skipping (short) isoform of ADARB1.

Alteration of miR-1271-5p induced considerable changes to mRNA abundance and translation which spanned a diverse range of cellular functions, including directly targeted genes strongly associated with cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular junctions. Mechanistic analyses additionally revealed that upregulation of miR-1271-5p predominantly repressed mRNAs through destabilisation, wherein 3´UTR and CDS binding sites exhibited similar efficacy. Knockdown, however, produced no discernible trend in target gene expression and strikingly resulted in increased expression of the highly conserved miR-96-5p which shares an identical seed region with miR-1271-5p, suggesting the presence of feedback mechanisms which sense disruptions to miRNA levels. These findings indicate that while bidirectional regulation of miR-1271-5p results in substantial remodelling of the neuronal transcriptome, these effects are not inverse in nature. In addition, we provide further support for the idea that destabilisation of mRNA is the predominant mechanism by which miRNAs regulate complementary mRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148827	Cells	5.656	https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9041014	{Cells (5.656): 10.3390/cells9041014}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA625926	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA625926	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP256886	[Overal design]Examination of changes in mRNA expression and translation in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells after overexpression or knockdown of miR-1271-5p; [Treatment]'Transfections were conducted 24 hours after removal of ATRA-medium.

GSE127713	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Cellular gene expression during Hepatitis C Virus replication revealed by Ribosome profiling	2019-03-01	"Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects human liver hepatocytes, often leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is believed that chronic infection alters host gene expression and favours HCC development. In particular, HCV replication in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) derived membranes induces chronic ER stress. How HCV replication affects host mRNA translation and transcription at a genome wide level is not yet known. Methods: We used Riboseq (Ribosome Profiling) to analyze transcriptome and translatome changes in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells replicating HCV for 6 days. Results: Established viral replication does not cause global changes in host gene expression - only around 30 genes are differentially expressed. Upregulated genes are related to ER stress, HCV replication and HCC development. Some mRNAs (PPP1R15A/GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, TRIB3) may be subject to uORF mediated translation control in response to stress-induced eIF2 inactivation. Transcriptional downregulation mainly affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complex genes. Conclusion: After establishing HCV replication, cellular gene expression is reprogrammed towards stress response and HCC development. Downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes indicates how a virus induces cancer cell-like metabolic reprogramming (""Warburg effect""). Thus, HCV escapes stress response pathways but induces selective gene expression changes which likely are beneficial for chronic infection and cancerogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127713	International journal of molecular sciences	4.183	https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20061321	{International journal of molecular sciences (4.183): 10.3390/ijms20061321}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA525090	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA525090	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP187206	[Overal design]Transcriptome and translatome changes in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells replicating HCV for 6 days in comparison to non-infected cells were analyzed, in triplicates, by NGS.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Six days post transfection cells were washed with ice-cold PBS with cycloheximide and harvested by adding 500 µl polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 % Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml, 20 U/ml TURBO DNase) per 15 cm2 dish\nLibraries were prepared using the ribosome profiling method.'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: Huh-7.5; time: 6 days post HCV transfection; molecule: Ribo protected RNA; ', 'cell line: Huh-7.5; time: 6 days post HCV transfection; molecule: Total RNA; ', 'cell line: Huh-7.5; time: 6 days post mock transfection; molecule: Ribo protected RNA; ', 'cell line: Huh-7.5; time: 6 days post mock transfection; molecule: Total RNA; '

These mutations are in the factors involved in splice site selection, including a missense mutation (Ser34Phe) in a conserved nucleic acid binding domain of the spicing factor U2AF1. This protein plays a critical role in recognition of the 3'-splice site and assembly of the pre-spliceosomal complex. However, the role that this mutation plays in oncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we have uncovered a non-canonical function of U2AF1. PAR-CLIP and RIP data show that U2AF1 directly binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and that binding on or near the start codon results in translational repression. This splicing-independent translational regulatory role of U2AF1 is altered by the S34F mutation, leading to elevated translation of hundreds of mRNA, as revealed by polysome profiling.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126912	Genes & development	8.99	https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.319590.118	{Genes & development (8.990): 10.1101/gad.319590.118}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA523666	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA523666	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP186535	"[Overal design]PAR-CLIP on Chromatin and Cytoplasmic fractions of Flp-In-293 cells expressing FLAG-HA tagged WT or S34F mutant U2AF1.

However, how widespread this remodeling is and whether structural changes can serve as additional regulatory steps for other regulators remains under-explored. Here, we assayed RNA structural dynamics, gene expression, translation and decay during different stages of human neuronal differentiation to understand the impact of RNA structures in stem cell regulation. RBP binding resulted in wide-spread RNA structure changes during early neuronal differentiation. Structure changes act as a common mechanism for RBPs to modulate the binding of additional RBPs and miRNAs to coordinate gene expression temporally. In particular, we showed that PUM2 binding on LIN28A resulted in RNA structure changes that enabled miR-30 binding, leading to downregulation of LIN28A. Compensatory mutagenesis experiments that lock specific structural states confirmed the importance of PUM2-induced structure changes in miR-30 regulation.

GSE31539	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13393	Ribosome footprinting in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum	2011-08-19	In eukaryotic cells, the spatial regulation of protein expression is frequently conferred through the coupling of mRNA localization and the local control of translation. mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent example of such regulation and serves a ubiquitous role in segregating the synthesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins to the ER. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a role for the ER in global protein synthesis. We have utilized cell fractionation and ribosome profiling to obtain a genomic survey of the subcellular organization of mRNA translation and report that ribosomal loading of mRNAs, a proxy for mRNA translation, is biased to the ER. Notably, ER-associated mRNAs encoding both cytosolic and topogenic signal-encoding proteins display similar ribosome loading densities, suggesting that ER-associated ribosomes serve a global role in mRNA translation. We propose that the partitioning of mRNAs and their translation between the cytosol and ER compartments may represent a novel mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31539	The Journal of biological chemistry	4.106	https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.312280	{The Journal of biological chemistry (4.106): 10.1074/jbc.M111.312280}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA145711	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA145711	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP007963	[Overal design]HEK293 cells were fractionated between the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum.

GSE22002	Homo sapiens	6	Expression profiling by array	GPL570	Analysis of HeLa cells after transfection with miR-1 or miR-155, by microarray profiling	2010-05-26	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ~22-nucleotide RNAs that mediate important gene-regulatory events by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct their repression. Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22002	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09267	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature09267}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA129165	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA129165	None	"[Overal design]Examine mRNA expression levels in HeLa cells transfected with miR-1 or miR-155, versus mock-transfected cells, at two different time points post-transfection.; [Treatment]'All samples were treated with cycloheximide (100 ug/ml) for 8 min just before harvesting.'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]""Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.""; [Cell type]'Source: ''transfection: mock; time: 32hr; ', 'transfection: miR-155 duplex; time: 32hr; ', 'transfection: miR-1 duplex; time: 32hr; ', 'transfection: mock; time: 12hr; ', 'transfection: miR-155 duplex; time: 12hr; ', 'transfection: miR-1 duplex; time: 12hr; '"

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but not transcriptional dysfunction. These results extend our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of TSC brain lesions, and suggest phenotype-tailored pharmacological treatment strategies.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78959	Genome medicine	10.886	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-016-0347-3	{Genome medicine (10.886): 10.1186/s13073-016-0347-3}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA314508	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA314508	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP071232	[Overal design]Two TSC+/- cell lines and two TSC-/- cell lines were independently generated from wild-type human embryonic stem cells by genome editting with zinc finger nucleases.

GSE103404	Homo sapiens	64	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Distinct cancer-promoting stromal gene expression depending on lung function	2017-09-01	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that lung stromal cells activate pathological gene expression programs supporting oncogenesis. To identify molecular mechanisms operating in the lung stroma that support development of lung cancer. Study subjects included patients with- or without- lung cancer across a spectrum of lung function. We conducted multi-omics analysis of non-malignant lung tissue to quantify the transcriptome, translatome and proteome. Cancer-associated gene expression changes predominantly manifested as alterations in the efficiency of mRNA translation modulating protein levels in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA levels. The molecular mechanisms driving these cancer-associated translation programs differed based on lung function. In subjects with normal to mildly impaired lung-function, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway served as an upstream driver; whereas in severe airflow obstruction, pathways downstream of pathological extracellular matrix (ECM) emerged. Consistent with a role during cancer initiation, both the mTOR and ECM gene expression programs paralleled activation of previously identified pro-cancer secretomes. Furthermore, in situ examination of lung tissue documented that stromal fibroblasts express cancer-associated proteins from the two pro-cancer secretomes including IL6 in mild or no airflow obstruction and BMP1 in severe airflow obstruction. Two distinct stromal gene expression programs promoting cancer initiation are activated in lung cancer patients depending on lung function. Our work has implications both for screening strategies and personalized approaches to cancer treatment.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103404	American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine	16.494	https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201801-0080OC	{American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine (16.494): 10.1164/rccm.201801-0080OC}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA401720	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA401720	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP116952	[Overal design]Polysome-profiling of non-cancerous lung stroma tissue samples from patients with or without lung cancer across a range of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Frozen lung tissue samples ranging in weight from 25-60 mg were individually ground to a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen cooled ceramic mortar and pestle.

Once the initial RNA QC was completed, polyribosome preparations were performed.  For this purpose, the remainder of each frozen powdered sample was solubilized in 100 µl of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 500 U/mL RNAsin RNAsin [Promega, Madison, WI], 40 mM VRC [vanadyl ribonucleoside complex], and 150 μg/ml cycloheximide [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO]) and mixed by pipetting.

Here, we use ribosome profiling and transcript analysis to experimentally define the HCMV translation products and follow their temporal expression. We identified several hundred previously unidentified open reading frames and confirmed a fraction by mass spectrometry. We found that regulated use of alternative transcript start sites plays a broad role in enabling tight temporal control of HCMV protein expression and allowing multiple distinct polypeptides to be generated from a single genomic locus.

GSE131111	Homo sapiens	30	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	Translational control of cardiac fibrosis (II)	2019-05-13	Background: Fibrosis is a common pathology in many cardiac disorders and is driven by the activation of resident fibroblasts. The global post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying fibroblast-to-myofibroblast conversion in the heart have not been explored. Methods: Genome-wide changes of RNA transcription and translation during human cardiac fibroblast activation were monitored with RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. We then used a RNA-binding protein-based analyses to identify translational regulators of fibrogenic genes. The integration with cardiac ribosome occupancy levels of 30 dilated cardiomyopathy patients demonstrates that these post-transcriptional mechanisms are also active in the diseased fibrotic human heart. Results: We generated nucleotide-resolution translatome data during the TGFβ1-driven cellular transition of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. This identified dynamic changes of RNA transcription and translation at several time points during the fibrotic response, revealing transient and early-responder genes. Remarkably, about one-third of all changes in gene expression in activated fibroblasts are subject to translational regulation and dynamic variation in ribosome occupancy affects protein abundance independent of RNA levels. Targets of RNA-binding proteins were strongly enriched in post-transcriptionally regulated genes, suggesting genes such as MBNL2 can act as translational activators or repressors. Ribosome occupancy in the hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy suggested the same post-transcriptional regulatory network was underlying cardiac fibrosis. Key network hubs include RNA-binding proteins such as PUM2 and QKI that work in concert to regulate the translation of target transcripts in human diseased hearts. Furthermore, silencing of both PUM2 and QKI inhibits the transition of fibroblasts toward pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts in response to TGFβ1. Conclusions: We reveal widespread translational effects of TGFβ1 and define novel post-transcriptional regulatory networks that control the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. These networks are active in human heart disease and silencing of hub genes limits fibroblast activation. Our findings show the central importance of translational control in fibrosis and highlight novel pathogenic mechanisms in heart failure.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131111	Circulation	23.054	https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.039596	{Circulation (23.054): 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.039596}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA542670	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA542670	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP198270	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of left ventricle tissue of 30 end-stage DCM patients; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Briefly, snap-frozen cell pellets or 50-100 mg of tissue, previously powdered under liquid nitrogen, were lysed in 1ml cold lysis buffer (formulation as in TruSeq Ribosome Profile, Illumina) supplemented with 0.1mg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to stabilize ribosomal subunits and prevent post-lysis translocation.

Measures of transcriptional mRNA levels may therefore misrepresent cellular activation. To test this hypothesis employing human physiological mRNA levels, we analyzed cytoplasmic and polyribosome-bound mRNA expression (Frac-seq) combined with microRNA profiling by small RNA-seq in bronchoepithelial cells from healthy and severe asthma (SA) donors, SA being a chronic inflammatory airways disease, poorly understood at the molecular level. We found 275 genes bound to polyribosomes differentially between healthy and severe asthma, of which only 11.64% overlapped with differentially expressed cytoplasmic mRNAs (226 genes). We found 335 alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms differentially bound to polyribosomes of which only ~8% were revealed by cytoplasmic mRNA analysis. Approximately two thirds of differentially expressed isoforms could not be found at the gene level in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound fractions, demonstrating the disruption of splicing in asthma. Only the analysis of differentially expressed isoforms bound to polyribosomes revealed disease-related pathways overlooked in total mRNA. We detected a network of 21 microRNAs differentially expressed, with 8 microRNAs accounting for more than 80% targeting observed in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNA isoforms. Importantly, microRNAs target distinct cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNAs. Hence this work, integrating deep-sequencing, subcellular fractionation and microRNA profiling, demonstrates the disruption of post-transcriptional regulatory processes as the main disease causing molecular mechanism in asthma, something that cannot be dissected employing more classic transcriptomics approaches alone.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85214	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA337894	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA337894	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP081022	[Overal design]We performed cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound RNA-seq of bronchial epithelial cells from healthy controls and severe asthmatic patients.

Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature proteasomal degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112891	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37018	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.37018}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA449388	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA449388	None	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of whole cell or streptavidin-purified ribosomes biotinylated by ER-localized biotin ligase in yeast This series includes re-analyzed samples from GSE61012 and GSE85686.; [Treatment]'Yeast cells were treated with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide for 2 minutes prior to biotin induction then induced with 10 nM biotin.

GSE143263	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	Thousands of novel unannotated proteins expand the MHC I immunopeptidome in cancer	2020-01-07	Tumor epitopes – peptides that are presented on surface-bound MHC I proteins - provide targets for cancer immunotherapy and have been identified extensively in the annotated protein-coding regions of the genome. Motivated by the recent discovery of translated novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we hypothesized that cancer-associated processes could generate nuORFs that can serve as a new source of tumor antigens that harbor somatic mutations or show tumor-specific expression. To identify cancer-specific nuORFs, we generated Ribo-seq profiles for 29 malignant and healthy samples. These included primary normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, patient-derived primary glioblastoma (GBM) and melanoma cell cultures, primary healthy melanocytes, as well as established colon carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. These also included B721.221 cells, the parental cell line previously used to generate 92 single HLA allele-expressing lines from which we collected mono-allelic MHC I immunopeptidome data. We developed a hierarchical approach to identify translated novel unannotated open reading frames that leverages the large amount of Ribo-seq data we have generated in order to uncover lowly expressed nuORFs, while also preserving tissue specificity. We constructed a database of novel unannotated ORFs (nuORFdb) and used it to analyze mass spectrometry datasets of MHC I-bound peptides, where we detected peptides from 3,555 nuORFs. Additionally, we used nuORFdb to identify cancer-specific nuORFs, as well as nuORFs harboring cancer-specific somatic variants as potential sources of neoantigens in cancer. *This repository contains data from the publicly available cell lines used in this study, including B721.221 cells, A375 cells, HCT116 cells and primary healthy melanocytes (Thermo C0025C).

GSE114794	Homo sapiens	57	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Nutrient deprivation elicits a transcriptional and translational inflammatory response coupled to decreased protein synthesis	2018-05-22	Purpose: The goal of this study is to examine gene expression regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels in response to various forms of nutrient deprivation, and whether there are differences between isogenic transformed and non-transformed cells. Mehods: We apply high-throughput sequencing of ribosome footprints (ribosome profiling) and poly(A) RNA (RNA sequencing) in an isogenic pair of transformed (tamoxifen-treated) and non-transformed (ethanol control) MCF10A-ER-Src cells subjected to the metabolic stresses that differentially affect global protein synthesis (Figure 1): deprivation of glutamine (for 30min and 4 hours), glucose (4hours), cysteine/cystine (4hours) or leucine/isoleucine/valine (brach-chain aminoacids - BCAA) (4hours). The same experiments were also performed in transformed ER-Src MCF10A treated with torin1 (500nM) for 4 hours. Results: Genome-wide translational profiling of glutamine deprived ER-Src MCF10A cells (for 30 minutes) shows increased translation of uORFs-containing mRNAs and down-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which is followed by increased translation and transcription of cytokine and inflammatory mRNAs (after 4 hours of glutamine deprivation). The transcription and translation of inflammatory and cytokine mRNAs is also stimulated in response to 4 hours deprivation of glucose, cysteine/cystine and BCAA, with the extent of stimulation correlating with the i) decrease in global protein synthesis and ii) down-regulation of all translationally-repressed mRNAs or ribosomal protein mRNAs. Conclusions: Pro-inflammatory gene expression is associated with translational repression in response to short-term nutrient deprivation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE114794	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.021	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.021}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA472636	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA472636	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP148767	[Overal design]Ribosome occupancy and mRNAs levels in transformed and non-transformed cells cultured for i) 30 minutes under complete (Ctrl) or glutamine-free (NoQ) DMEM medium, and ii) 4 hours under complete (Ctrl), glucose-free (NoG), glutamine-free (NoQ), cysteine/cystine-free (NoCys) or leucine, isoleucine, valine (NoBCAA)-free DMEM medium.

GSE142898	Homo sapiens	3	Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes [miRNA-seq]	2020-01-02	The biological impact of microRNAs is determined by their targets, and robustly identifying direct miRNA targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present a simple approach to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using PRO-seq with RNA-seq. In combination, these methods allow us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. We identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the coding region. CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that underlie downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP is particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142898	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa687	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkaa687}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA598737	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA598737	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP239341	[Overal design]MicroRNA profiling of HEK293 cells with and without specific miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing using Illumina NextSeq500.; [Treatment]'The cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors with or without miRNA expression cassette.

While gene regulation is a multi-step process, the majority of research concerning divergence in gene regulation among primates has focused on transcription. To gain a comprehensive view of gene regulation, we surveyed genome-wide ribosome occupancy, which reflects levels of protein translation, in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. We further integrated mRNA and protein level measurements collected from matching cell lines. We find that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, the major factor determining protein level divergence between human and closely related species is post-translational buffering. Inter-species divergence in transcription is generally propagated to the level of protein translation. In contrast, gene expression divergence is often attenuated post-translationally, potentially mediated through post-translational modifications. Results from our analysis indicate that post-translational buffering is a conserved mechanism that led to relaxation of selective constraint on transcript levels in humans.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71808	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1451-z	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-018-1451-z}	'cytoplasmic RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292112	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292112	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP062129	[Overal design]Using ribosome profiling assays, we measured levels of protein translation transcriptome-wide in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 4 HapMap Yoruba individuals, 5 chimpanzee individuals, and 5 rhesus macaque individuals.

GSE14000	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by array	GPL570	Fine-tuning of human dendritic cells regulation revealed by translational profiling	2008-12-16	Dendritic cells (DCs) are the sentinels of the mammalian immune system and they undergo a complex maturation process mediated by activation upon pathogen detection. Recent studies described the analysis of activated DCs by transcriptional profiling, but translation regulation was never taken in account. Therefore, the nature of the mRNAs being translated at various stages of DC activation was determined with the help of translational profiling, which is the sucrose gradient fractionation of polysomal-bound mRNAs combined to microarrays analysis. Total and polysomal-bound mRNA populations were compared in immature (0h) and LPS-stimulated (4h and 16h) human monocyte-derived DCs with the help of Affymetrix microarrays. Biostatistical analysis indicated that 296 mRNA molecules are translationally regulated during DC-activation. The most abundant biological process among the regulated mRNAs was protein biosynthesis, indicating the existence of a negative feedback loop regulating translation. Interestingly, a cluster of 17 ribosomal proteins were part of the regulated mRNAs, indicating that translation may be fine-tuned by particular components of the translational machinery. Our observations highlight the importance of translation regulation during the immune response, and may favour the identification of novel gene clusters or protein networks relevant for immunity. Our study also provides information on the possible absence of correlation between gene expression and real protein production in DCs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14000	Immunome research	None	https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-7580-5-5	{Immunome research (None): 10.1186/1745-7580-5-5}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA112501	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA112501	None	[Overal design]To identify translationally regulated mRNA molecules, gene expression derived from the polysome-bound mRNAs was compared by Affymetrix microarrays analysis to the gene expression derived from unfractionated total mRNAs derived from whole-cell lysates, as recently described on several reports (Johannes 1999, Rajasekhar 2003, Bushell 2006, Lü 2006, Parent 2008).

Here we combine SLAM-seq, a novel method for direct quantification of newly synthesized mRNAs, with pharmacological and rapid chemical-genetic perturbation to interrogate primary transcriptional targets of BRD4 and MYC and define the response to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). While BRD4 acts as a global co-activator of Pol2-dependent transcription in a BET bromodomain-dependent manner, therapeutic BETi doses deregulate a small set of hypersensitive target genes. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator that controls basic metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de-novo purine synthesis across diverse cancer contexts. Beyond defining primary regulatory functions of BRD4 and MYC in cancer, our study establishes a simple, robust and scalable approach to dissect direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100708	Science (New York, N.Y.)	41.037	https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao2793	{Science (New York, N.Y.)

GSE138641	Homo sapiens	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Stop Codon Context Influences Genome-Wide Stimulation of Termination Codon Readthrough by Aminoglycosides [Dataset 4]	2019-10-09	Stop codon readthrough (SCR) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138641	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576652	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576652	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224955	[Overal design]2 ribosome profiling samples are included from HEK293T cells; [Treatment]'Aminoglycosides were added to cells, and treated for 24 hours'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS to ~75% confluency before harvest'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed on ice in the presence of cycloheximide.

An essential part of this technology is removal of unwanted, normally abundant, ribosomal RNA sequences in order to save on sequencing costs. The most effective commercial solution (Ribo-Zero) has been discontinued and a number of new, experimentally distinct commercial applications have emerged on the market. Here we evaluated several commercially available alternatives designed for RNA-seq of human samples and find them unsuitable for ribosome footprint profiling. We instead recommend the use of custom-designed biotinylated oligos, which were widely used in early ribosome profiling studies. Importantly, we warn that depletion solutions based on targeted nuclease cleavage significantly perturb the high-resolution information that can be derived from the data, and thus do not recommend their use for any applications that require precise determination of the ends of RNA fragments.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147324	RNA (New York, N.Y.)	3.949	https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.075523.120	{RNA (New York, N.Y.)

GSE26549	Homo sapiens	86	Expression profiling by array	GPL6244	Gene Expression Profiling Predicts the Development of Oral Cancer	2011-01-11	Patients with oral preneoplastic lesion (OPL) have high risk of developing oral cancer. Although certain risk factors such as smoking status and histology are known, our ability to predict oral cancer risk remains poor. The study objective was to determine the value of gene expression profiling in predicting oral cancer development. Gene expression profile was measured in 86 of 162 OPL patients who were enrolled in a clinical chemoprevention trial that used the incidence of oral cancer development as a prespecified endpoint. The median follow-up time was 6.08 years and 35 of the 86 patients developed oral cancer over the course. Gene expression profiles were associated with oral cancer-free survival and used to develope multivariate predictive models for oral cancer prediction. We developed a 29-transcript predictive model which showed marked improvement in terms of prediction accuracy (with 8% predicting error rate) over the models using previously known clinico-pathological risk factors. Based on the gene expression profile data, we also identified 2182 transcripts significantly associated with oral cancer risk associated genes (P-value<0.01, single variate Cox proportional hazards model). Functional pathway analysis revealed proteasome machinery, MYC, and ribosomes components as the top gene sets associated with oral cancer risk. In multiple independent datasets, the expression profiles of the genes can differentiate head and neck cancer from normal mucosa. Our results show that gene expression profiles may improve the prediction of oral cancer risk in OPL patients and the significant genes identified may serve as potential targets for oral cancer chemoprevention.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE26549	Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)	3.866	https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0155	{Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)

GSE144163	Homo sapiens	4	Other	GPL18573	Ribosome profiling of ABCE1-knockout cells	2020-01-23	Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a pathway that degrades messenger RNAs containing premature termination codons. Here, a genome-wide screen for NMD factors uncovered an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen revealed that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which in turn is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway converges on the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in the movement of ribosomes into 3ʹ UTRs where they displace exon junction complexes, thereby abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3ʹ UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Due to the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3ʹ UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144163	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107895	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107895}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA602917	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA602917	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP244436	[Overal design]Method: Ribosome profiling was performed in HCT116 cells that received, via lentivirus, Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting either ABCE1 or non-targeting control sgRNAs.

GSE89629	Mus musculus	6	Expression profiling by array	GPL6887	The thrombopoietin/MPL axis is activated in the Gata1 low mouse model of myelofibrosis and is associated with a defective RPS14 signature [spleen]	2016-11-07	Myelofibrosis (MF) is caused by genetic abnormalities involving the thrombopoietin (TPO)/MPL/JAK2 axis. Furthermore MF patients have elevated serum TPO levels. MF is also associated with reduced GATA1 content in MK suggesting that this abnormality represents a phenotypic modifier. In 2014, Dr. Crispino suggested that in MF abnormal TPO signaling induces a ribosomal deficiency hampering GATA1 mRNA translation in MK. Support for MK GATA1 deficiency as “phenotypic modifier” in MF was provided by the observation that mice carrying the Gata1low mutation reducing Gata1 transcription in MK develop myelofibrosis. Since reduced RBC half-life subject these mice to continuous “erythroid stress”, we investigated the TPO/Mpl axis in this model. In Gata1low and wild-type mice, TPO mRNA was expressed by bone marrow (BM), spleen and liver. The greatest expression (by 300-fold) was detected in liver. Gata1low livers expressed TPO mRNA levels 6-fold greater than wild-type livers. TPO protein was detected in BM, spleen, liver and peritoneum washes and plasma. The greatest levels where detected in plasma. Gata1low plasma contained TPO levels 2-fold lower than wild-type plasma, but 2-times greater than plasma from bleed wild-type mice and Mplnull mice with similar thrombocytopenia, suggesting that TPO is overproduced in Gata1low mice. JAK2 and STAT5 were easily detected in Gata1low BM bur barely detectable in wild-type BM, suggesting that in the former MPL is prompt to signaling activation. Furthermore, Gata1low LSK expressed levels of Mpl mRNA 3-times greater than wild-type cells but expressed cell-surface levels of MPL 2-times lower than wild-type cells and similar to those on LSK from TPO-treated wild-type mice, suggesting that MPL is down-modulated in Gata1low LSK. The Crispino’s hypothesis that in MF activation of TPO/MPL/JAK2 induces a ribosomal deficiency hampering GATA1 mRNA translation and the realization that this axis is activated in Gata1low mice made us question the original hypothesis that reduced content of GATA1 in Gata1low MK results from deletion of lineage-specific enhancers. Microarray analyses indeed identified that Gata1low BM express a discordant ribosome signature including reduced expression of RPS24 and RPS36A, two genes mutated in Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a disease characterized by inefficient GATA1 mRNA translation. Electron microscopy identified that the cytoplasm of Gata1low MK contained poorly developed endoplasmic reticulum with rare polysomes. In conclusion, these results validate the Gata1low model as a MF model by indicating that these mice express an activated TPO/MPL axis and an abnormal ribosomal signature which may reduce efficiency of Gata1 mRNA translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89629	Blood cancer journal	7.895	https://doi.org/10.1038/bcj.2017.51	{Blood cancer journal (7.895): 10.1038/bcj.2017.51}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA352764	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA352764	None	"[Overal design]genetic_modification_design; [Treatment]'The cells were not treated in any way'; [Growth]'These are primary spleen cells from mice matched for sex and age.

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138639	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576650	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576650	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224953	[Overal design]4 ribosome profiling samples are included from HEK293T cells; [Treatment]'Aminoglycosides were added to cells, and treated for 24 hours'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS to ~75% confluency before harvest'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed on ice in the presence of cycloheximide.

GSE69047	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL16791	Time-Resolved Proteomics Extends Ribosome Profiling-Based Measurements of Protein Synthesis Dynamics	2015-05-19	Ribosome profiling is a widespread tool for studying translational dynamics in human cells. Its central assumption is that ribosome footprint density on a transcript quantitatively reflects protein synthesis. Here, we test this assumption using pulsed-SILAC (pSILAC) high-accuracy targeted proteomics. We focus on multiple myeloma cells exposed to bortezomib, a first-line chemotherapy and proteasome inhibitor. In the absence of drug effects, we found that direct measurement of protein synthesis by pSILAC correlated well with indirect measurement of synthesis from ribosome footprint density. This correlation, however, broke down under bortezomib-induced stress. By developing a statistical model integrating longitudinal proteomic and mRNA-seq measurements, we found that proteomics could directly detect global alterations in translational rate caused by bortezomib; these changes are not detectable by ribosomal profiling alone. Further, by incorporating pSILAC data into a gene expression model, we predict cell-stress specific proteome remodeling events. These results demonstrate that pSILAC provides an important complement to ribosome profiling in measuring proteome dynamics.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69047	Cell systems	8.64	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.05.001	{Cell systems (8.640): 10.1016/j.cels.2017.05.001}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA284399	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA284399	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP058501	[Overal design]Timecourse experiment with six points over 48hr after bortezomib exposure in MM.1S myeloma cells. mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling data at each time point.; [Treatment]'Cells were treated with 0.5 nM bortezomib'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'mRNA-seq and ribosome footprint samples were prepared by the method of Ingolia et al.

Methods: High-resolution gene expression profiles of embryonic endothelial cells (EC) using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and single cell RNA-sequencing. RNA-sequenzing of transcription factor infected HUVEC. Results: Comparisons of different organ-, temporal- or Ctnnb1 knock out-specific vascular translatomes revealed extensive molecular changes during the unique development of the brain endothelium. We identified brain endothelial-specific transcription factors – Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1, Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551 and Zic3 – that are associated with the temporal maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling pathway. Profiling individual EC revealed a remarkable heterogeneity. Nevertheless, high levels of Foxf2, Foxq1, Ppard and Zic3 were correlated with elevated expression of differentiation markers. This could be recapitulated in vitro, where expression of Foxf2 and Zic3 in HUVEC led to an induction of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. Conclusions: Our study provides further insights into the temporal and cellular complexity of the developing embryonic brain endothelium. Our data raises many questions and provides a basis for further studies aiming to unravel cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie vascular development and differentiation in the CNS. We anticipate that additional investigation of the identified transcription factors is likely to be a fruitful approach in understanding and manipulating the development of BBB and to engineer more advanced blood brain barrier in vitro models.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79306	Science signaling	6.481	https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aag2476	{Science signaling (6.481): 10.1126/scisignal.aag2476}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA315441	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA315441	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP071876	[Overal design]TRAP-seq profiles for E11.5 till E17.5 wild type (WT) brain EC; E14.5 and E17.5 endothelial Ctnnb1 -/- brain EC; E14.5 head, heart, kidney, limb, liver and lung WT EC in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

Consistent with previous reports, RNA structures are dominant features for STAU1 binding to CDSs and 3ʹUTRs. Overall, relative to short 3ʹUTR counterparts, longer 3ʹUTR isoforms of genes have stronger STAU1 binding, most likely due to a higher frequency of RNA structures, including specialized IRAlus. However, a sizable fraction of genes express transcripts showing the opposite trend, attributable to AU-rich sequences in their alternative 3'UTRs, possibly recruiting antagonistic RBPs and/or destabilizing STAU1-binding RNA structures. Using STAU1-knockout cells, we show that strong STAU1 binding to mRNA 3'UTRs generally enhances polysome association. However, IRAlus have little impact on STAU1-mediated polysome association despite having strong interactions with the protein.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148771	RNA (New York, N.Y.)	3.949	https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.076133.120	{RNA (New York, N.Y.)

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71891	Molecular cancer therapeutics	4.856	https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414	{Molecular cancer therapeutics (4.856): 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414}	'protein'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292425	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292425	None	[Overal design]Secreted protein profiles of MCF7 and HCT116 Akti-1/2 treated cells and MCF7 and HCT116 vehicle (i.e. DMSO) treated cells were generated using antibody arrays.; [Treatment]'MCF7 and HCT116 cells were treated either with DMSO or Akti-1/2 for 6 days and culture supernatant were collected and frozen at -80°C until analysis.'; [Growth]'MCF7 was maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 40mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin; HCT116 was maintained in McCoy’s 5α medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin.

Here we report the ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells and brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which leads to the identification of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) as a CSC- specific determinant. We confirmed that GPD1 is expressed in BTSCs but not in neural stem cells. Intriguingly, expression of GPD1 is only found in the infiltrating dormant BTSCs in vivo and these cells start to divide and drive tumour relapse after chemotherapy. Most importantly, inhibition of GPD1 expression in tumour-bearing mice leads to prolonged survival. Further analysis shows that loss of GPD1 results in widespread changes in important pathways affecting BTSC maintenance. Human patient data analysis suggests that GPD1 is expressed in the dormant infiltrating tumour cells in human glioblastoma and the expression level is associated with a worse prognosis. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumours and a novel aspect of regulation of CSC dormancy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110866	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA434716	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA434716	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP133147	[Overal design]Two neural stem cell samples and three brain tumor stem cell samples are used in ribosome profiling experiments.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'The cells of a 15 cm culture plate were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl, 1 % Triton, 2 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml Cyclohexamide, 25 U/ml DNase and EDTA-free protease inhibitors, Roche).

The mechanism of anemia involves an impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis of erythroblasts. Here we show that GATA1 protein expression is low in line with a defect in the representation of its mRNA at the ribosome. A global analysis of transcripts on polysomes indicates that translation is selective with a decreased representation of the transcripts with a short coding sequence and UTRs and a highly structured 3’UTR, a subset of transcripts that includes GATA1. Our whole proteome analysis confirms that post-transcriptionally downregulated proteins were encoded by transcripts with a short length and structured 3’UTR. We identified a subset of post-translationally downregulated proteins including ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors encoded by 5’TOP mRNAs that were enriched on the ribosome. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic characteristics of 3’UTR and in a lesser extend 5’UTR and the transcript length are the determinants of translation selectivity under RPS14 haploinsufficiency conditions and that a post-translational regulation of ribosomal proteins accounts for their decreased content in the cell.

We have applied RiboMeth-seq to rRNA from HeLa cells for ribosome-wide, quantitative mapping of 2'-O-Me sites and obtained a comprehensive set of 106 sites, including two novel sites, and with plausible box C/D guide RNAs assigned to all but three sites. We find approximately two-thirds of the sites to be fully methylated and the remainder to be fractionally modified in support of ribosome heterogeneity at the level of RNA modifications. A comparison to HCT116 cells reveals similar 2'-O-Me profiles with distinct differences at several sites. This constitutes the first comprehensive mapping of 2'-O-Me sites in human rRNA using a high throughput sequencing approach and paves the way for experimental analyses of the role of variations in rRNA methylation under different physiological or pathological settings.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76393	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw482	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkw482}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA307191	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA307191	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP067890	"[Overal design]HTC116 and HeLa cells were subjected to RiboMeth-seq analysis. 3 barcoded sequencing adapters were used to produce 3 individual libraries from HTC116 RNA sequenced on 1 individual Ion Proton sequencing chip, and 3 x 2 individual libraries from HeLa RNA sequenced on 2 individual Ion Proton sequencing chips.

To obtain a genome-wide perspective of the effects of radiation on gene translation, microarray analysis was done on polysome-bound RNA isolated from irradiated human brain tumor cells; to allow for a comparison with the effects of radiation on transcription, microarray analysis was also done using total RNA. The number of genes whose translational activity was modified by radiation was f10-fold greater than those whose transcription was affected. The radiation-induced change in a gene’s translational activity was shown to involve the recruitment of existing mRNAs to and away from polysomes. Moreover, the change in a gene’s translational activity after irradiation correlated with changes in the level of its corresponding protein. These data suggest that radiation modifies gene expression primarily at the level of translation. In contrast to transcriptional changes, there was considerable overlap in the genes affected at the translational level among brain tumor cell lines and normal astrocytes. Thus, the radiation-induced translational control of a subset of mRNAs seems to be a fundamental component of cellular radioresponse.

GSE89183	Homo sapiens	14	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL16791	Consequences of Ribosomal Protein Haploinsufficiency in Human Hematopoiesis	2016-10-25	Ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency (RPH) underlies diverse human diseases with distinct and specific phenotypes, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the erythroid-specific hematopoietic defects observed in DBA, only recently has the role of selectively impaired translation been highlighted in these phenotypes. Exactly how and to what extent this impairment of translation occurs is currently unknown. Here, by identifying a novel DBA gene affecting ribosome biogenesis, we show that both RPH and impaired ribosome biogenesis (IRB) limit the availability of actively translating ribosomes, resulting in the hematopoietic and translational defects observed in DBA. Our results show that the selective impairment of translation is due to a quantitative defect, where ribosomes of invariant protein composition have a reduced abundance, rather than a qualitative defect, where a subset of ribosomes lack specific ribosomal proteins (RPs) and thus may have altered translational capacity. In RPH, we find that cellular RP homeostasis is largely maintained through translational co-regulation, and we identify a selective subset of transcripts that have impaired association with the ribosome. Surprisingly, these transcripts have short and unstructured 5’ UTRs and are highly abundant and efficiently translated in healthy human erythroid progenitors, suggesting that the impaired translation of a number of key transcripts, including GATA1, may underlie DBA. Overall, our study identifies mechanisms by which RPH and IRB affect mRNA translation, illuminating how these alterations can result in cell-type specific defects and cause human disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89183	Cell	36.216	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.036	{Cell (36.216): 10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.036}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA350543	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA350543	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP092068	[Overal design](mRNA-seq) RNA-seq for control (shLuc), RPL5 knockdown (shRPL5), RPS19 knockdown (shRPS19), and TSR2 knockdown (shTSR2) was performed for two biological replicates of primary human erythroid cells at Day 7 of in vitro culture.

Ribo-Seq is based on sequencing all the ribosome protected mRNA fragments in a cell, while PUNCH-P is based on mass-spectrometric analysis of only newly synthesized proteins. Here we describe the first Ribo-Seq/PUNCH-P comparison via the analysis of mammalian cells during the cell-cycle for detecting relevant differentially expressed genes between G1 and M phase. Our analyses suggest that the two approaches significantly overlap with each other. However, we demonstrate that there are biologically meaningful proteins/genes that can be detected to be post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle only by each of the approaches, or their consolidation. Such gene sets are enriched with proteins known to be related to intra-cellular signalling pathways such as central cell cycle processes, central gene expression regulation processes, processes related to chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and replication, that are post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle. Moreover, we show that combining the approaches better predicts steady state changes in protein abundance. The results reported here support the conjecture that for gaining a full post-transcriptional regulation picture one should integrate the two approaches.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73565	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA297338	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA297338	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP064313	[Overal design]Two Ribo-Seq experiments, which included parallel RNA-Seq, one with 3 replicates, and the other with one replicate, totalling 4 technical replicates for the G1 and M phases of the cell cycle, respectively (totalling 16 samples), were performed.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Total mRNA and ribosome-protected fragments were analyzed essentially as described in [PMID:22836135].

Using selective ribosome profiling, we made the unexpected observation that eIF3 remains bound to post-initiation 80S ribosomes, followed by release after translation of ~50 codons. Furthermore, eIF3 deficiency reduces early ribosomal elongation speed, particularly on mRNAs encoding proteins associated with membrane-associated functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins and abnormal mitochondrial and lysosomal physiology. Accordingly, heterozygous eIF3e+/- knockout mice accumulate giant mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength with age. Hence, in addition to its canonical role in translation initiation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for normal muscle health.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149697	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.003	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.003}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA629777	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA629777	None	"[Overal design]Control and eIF3e depleted cells used for tRNA abundance - 5 biological replicates in total; 3- wildtype and 2-eIF3e depleted; [Treatment]'The cells were treated with 20nM si-control or si-eIF3e for 72h.'; [Growth]'MCF-10a cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium with 0.5mg/mL hydrocortisone, 10µg/mL insulin, 20ng/mL EGF, 5% serum, 1X Pen/Strep, and incubate in 37℃ with 5% CO2.\nCell were grown independently for each biological experiment and checked frequently for mycoplasma contamination.'; [Extraction]""Total RNA for total tRNA arrays was extracted using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich)  according to manufacturer's protocol""; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: MCF-10A; treatment: si-control; ', 'treatment: siRNA for eIF3e; cell line: MCF-10A; '"

Here we modified yeast Translational Complex Profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adopted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ses) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ses), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ses distribute similarly across 5’UTRs indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed a variation called Selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq) enabling selection for 40Ses and 80Ses associated with an immuno-targeted factor in yeast and human. Sel- TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5’UTRs with scanning 40Ses to successively dissociate upon start codon recognition. Manifesting the Sel-TCP-seq versatility for gene expression studies, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139131	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.004	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.004}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA578565	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA578565	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP226389	[Overal design]2 replicates for 40S and 80S TCP-seq, 1 replicate for eIF3b bound 40S Sel-TCP-seq and mRNA; [Treatment]'incubation of the cell culture with 0.3 % w/v formaldehyde for 5 min in a cold room'; [Growth]'3.5 Mio cell seeded into one Ø 15 cm dish, 48 h growth, around 80 % confluency at harvest; growth at 37ºC, 5 % CO2, in DMEM + 10% FBS (20 ml per dish)'; [Extraction]'in-plate cell lysis with detergent, RNase I digestion to generate ribosomal footprints, 40S/80S separation (followed by Co-IP if indicated), hot acid phenol RNA extraction\naccording to Ingolia et al., 2010, Methods Enzymol (different RNA fragment size selection, different set of rRNA depletion oligos)', 'in-plate cell lysis with detergent, total RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini Kit, poly(A) selection with poly(A)Purist MAG Kit, fragmentation\naccording to Ingolia et al., 2010, Methods Enzymol (different RNA fragment size selection, different set of rRNA depletion oligos)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''antibody: no; cell line: HEK293T; protocol: RNA 80S footprint; ', 'antibody: no; cell line: HEK293T; protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'antibody: yes (goat polyclonal anit-eIF3b, sc16377); cell line: HEK293T; protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'antibody: no; cell line: HEK293T; protocol: RNA-seq; '
GSE145722	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL20301	Genome-wide survey of ribosome collision [eif5A siRNA]	2020-02-21	In protein synthesis, ribosome movement is not always smooth, rather often impeded by numerous reasons. Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3′ UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145722	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107610	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107610}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA607999	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA607999	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP250317	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction.\nRNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification for ribosome profiling.'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: HEK293; sirna: control; treatment: Cycloheximide; ', 'cell line: HEK293; sirna: eif5A; treatment: Cycloheximide; '

Regulators of translation and ribosomal proteins were prominent among these, and expression of RPL15, a component of the large ribosome subunit, was sufficient to increase metastatic growth in multiple organs. RPL15 overexpression selectively increases translation of other ribosomal proteins and cell cycle regulators. Unsupervised analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing of freshly-isolated CTCs from breast cancer patients identifies a subset with strong ribosomal and protein translation signatures, correlated with increased proliferative markers, epithelial markers and poor clinical outcome. Thus, ribosome protein expression identifies an aggressive subset of CTCs, whose therapeutic targeting may suppress metastatic progression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143624	Science (New York, N.Y.)	41.037	https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay0939	{Science (New York, N.Y.)

GSE112085	Homo sapiens	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL16791	Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells [RNA-seq]	2018-03-20	The uneven use of synonymous codons in the transcriptome regulates the efficiency and fidelity of protein translation rates. Yet, the importance of this codon bias on regulating cell state-specific expression programs is currently debated. Here, we asked whether the gene expression program in the well-defined cell states of self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells is driven by optimized codon usage. Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identified distinct codon signatures for human self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. One driver for the cell state-specific codon bias was the genomic GC-content of the differentially expressed genes and thus, determined by transcription rather than translation. However, by measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome’s active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we discovered that the wobble position tRNA modification inosine strongly influenced the codon optimization in self-renewing embryonic stem cells. This effect was conserved in mice and independent of the differentiation stimulus. In summary, we newly reveal how translational mechanisms based on RNA modifications can shape optimized codon usage in embryonic stem cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112085	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1726-z	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-019-1726-z}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA439265	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA439265	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP136094	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and total RNA from self-renewing and differentiating human H9 cells, 4 biological replicates per condition; [Treatment]'Differentiating hESC were cultured in MEF-conditioned KSR media plus 1uM retinoic acid in DMSO, while the control hESC population was maintained in MEF-conditioned KSR media completed with 4 ng/mL FGF2.

In this study, we developed a new feasible method measuring poly(A)-tail length called TED-seq and applied it to investigate the change of mRNA's poly(A)-tail lengths in ER stress pharmacologically induced by thapsigargin (THAP). Combined with other global RNA analyses such as RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and PRO-seq, we observed that ER stress induced lenthening poly(A)-tail length, in particular of ER-stress-regulators, upon ER stress. More specifically, these mRNAs are translationally de-repressed and more stabilized based on increase in poly(A)-tail length. We also identified that insoluble fractions which include stress-induced RNA-granules have overall shorter length of poly(A) tail. Taken together, our data suggest that poly(A)-tail lengths are dynamically regulated and influence both translation efficiency and mRNA stability in ER stress.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103719	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA406823	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA406823	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP117282	"[Overal design]1) TED-seq (5 replicates) in cytoplasm and RNA granule fractions (3 replicates) of DMSO- or THAP-treated HEK293 cells 2) RNA-seq (4 replicates), Ribo-seq (4 replicates) and PRO-seq (2 replicates) in whole cells with DMSO- or THAP-treated HEK293 cells; [Treatment]'For ER stress induction, thapsigargin (THAP, Sigma-Aldrich) was treated with 2 µM for 2 h in HEK293 cells.'; [Growth]'HEK293 cells were cultured in MEM (Gibco) media with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 degrees Celsius.'; [Extraction]""Cell fractionation was performed by differential centrifugation following by THAP treatment (2 μM for 2 hr).

Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52809	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13007	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature13007}	'cytoplasmic RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA230112	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA230112	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP033369	[Overal design]64 samples from a variety of species; [Treatment]'RNA-seq: Cytoplasmically-enriched RNA was extracted, poly(A)-selected, randomly fragmented by partial alkaline hydrolysis and then size-selected RNA fragments were used for library preparation.

GSE138417	Homo sapiens	50	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL24676	Selective Inhibitors of mTORC1 Activate 4EBP1 and Suppress Tumor Growth	2019-10-03	The clinical benefit of current mTOR inhibitors is limited, perhaps reflecting their intrinsic pharmacological profiles. Rapamycin analogs selectively inhibit mTORC1, but fail to suppress phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1, a translational repressor that is a key driver of oncogenic mTORC1 signaling. mTOR kinase active-site inhibitors fully suppress mTORC1 and phosphorylation of its substrates, but are active against mTORC2 and additional kinases, potentially contributing to tolerability limitations. The prototype bi-steric inhibitor RapaLink-1 exploits the selective mTORC1 interactions of rapamycin and the broad mTOR kinase inhibitory effects of an active-site inhibitor, through covalent linkage of the two pharmacophores to achieve complete mTORC1/2 inhibition. We demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of RapaLink-1 is dependent upon mTORC1 and suppression of 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Using a rational design strategy, we tuned the affinities of the rapamycin core and ATP-mimetic moieties to create novel bi-steric inhibitors with enhanced mTORC1 selectivity and potency against 4EBP1 phosphorylation. mTORC1-selective bi-steric compounds produced durable inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, and drove tumor regressions at well-tolerated doses in xenograft models of breast cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138417	Nature chemical biology	12.154	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-021-00813-7	{Nature chemical biology (12.154): 10.1038/s41589-021-00813-7}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA575792	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA575792	None	[Overal design]4 biological replicates of MCF7 cells under one of the following conditions: Starvation, Full serum + DMSO, Full serum + MLN0128, Full serum + RMC-4627, Full serum + RMC-4745.

Here we developed a generalizable proximity-specific ribosome profiling strategy that enables global interrogation of translation in defined subcellular locations. We applied this approach to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in yeast and mammals. We observed the vast majority of secretory proteins to be co-translationally translocated, including substrates capable of post-translational insertion in vitro. Distinct translocon complexes engaged nascent chains at different points during synthesis. Whereas most proteins engaged the ER immediately following or even before signal sequence (SS) emergence, a class of Sec66-dependent proteins entered with a looped SS conformation. Finally, we observed rapid ribosome exchange into the cytosol following translation termination. These data provide insights into how distinct translocation mechanisms act in concert to promote efficient co-translational recruitment.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61012	Science (New York, N.Y.)

Here we identify a cluster of lncRNA transcripts from Myh7 loci and demonstrate a new lncRNA–chromatin mechanism for heart failure. In mice, these transcripts, which we named myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (Mhrt), are cardiac-specific and abundant in adult hearts. Pathological stress activates the Brg1–Hdac–Parp chromatin repressor complex3 to inhibit Mhrt transcription in the heart. Such stress-induced Mhrt repression is essential for cardiomyopathy to develop: restoring Mhrt to the pre-stress level protects the heart from hypertrophy and failure. Mhrt antagonizes the function of Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling factor that is activated by stress to trigger aberrant gene expression and cardiac myopathy3. Mhrt prevents Brg1 from recognizing its genomic DNA targets, thus inhibiting chromatin targeting and gene regulation by Brg1. It does so by binding to the helicase domain of Brg1, a domain that is crucial for tethering Brg1 to chromatinized DNA targets. Brg1 helicase has dual nucleic-acid-binding specificities: it is capable of binding lncRNA (Mhrt) and chromatinized—but not naked—DNA. This dual-binding feature of helicase enables a competitive inhibition mechanism by which Mhrt sequesters Brg1 from its genomic DNA targets to prevent chromatin remodelling. A Mhrt–Brg1 feedback circuit is thus crucial for heart function. Human MHRT also originates from MYH7 loci and is repressed in various types of myopathic hearts, suggesting a conserved lncRNA mechanism in human cardiomyopathy. Our studies identify a cardioprotective lncRNA, define a new targeting mechanism for ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors, and establish a new paradigm for lncRNA–chromatin interaction.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49716	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13596	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature13596}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA214890	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA214890	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP028720	[Overal design]Overexpression of murine non-coding RNAs in human cell line, comparison of RNA-sequencing with Ribosome Profiling; [Treatment]'1 x 10^7 SW13 cells were transfected with 5ug of Add2-Mhrt779 and Add2-Hotair at 80% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen #11668) and reduced serum medium Opti-MEM (Gibco #31985).

GSE34966	Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron	6	Expression profiling by array	GPL7006	Chronic colitis in Bacteroides Thetaiotaomicron-Monoassociated HLA-B27 Transgenic rats alters expression of receptor and metabolic genes in luminal bacteria.	2012-01-10	Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may be caused in part by aberrant immune responses to commensal intestinal microbes including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B.theta). Healthy, germ-free HLA-B27 transgenic (Tg) rats develop chronic colitis when colonized with complex gut commensal bacteria whereas non-transgenic (nTg) rats remain disease-free. However, the role of B.theta, a well-characterized anaerobic commensal bacterium, in causing disease in Tg rats is unknown nor is much known about how microbes respond to host inflammation. Methods: Tg and nTg rats were monoassociated with a human isolate of B.theta. Colonic inflammation was quantified by blinded histological scoring and real-time RT-PCR assays of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cecal bacterial concentrations were measured by quantitative plating. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of B.theta recovered from ceca was performed using custom GeneChips and data analyzed using dChip, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. Results: B.theta monoassociated Tg rats had significantly more colonic inflammation and increased colonic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs compared to nTg controls. Transcriptional profiles of cecal B.theta were significantly different in Tg vs. nTg rats. GSEA revealed that the Gene Ontology molecular function of receptor activity, which is comprised mainly of genes that encode nutrient binding proteins, was significantly enriched with genes upregulated in B.theta from Tg rats. KEGG canonical pathways of ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and metabolism were significantly enriched with genes downregulated in B.theta from Tg rats. Numbers of viable bacteria/gram cecal contents in Tg vs. nTg rats were not significantly different. Conclusions: B.theta induces mild colitis in HLA-B27 Tg rats, which is associated with changes in the expression of microbial metabolic and nutrient binding pathways, but no difference in concentrations of luminal bacteria. Mechanistic studies of differentially expressed B.theta genes may reveal novel pathways that contribute to IBD.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE34966	PloS one	2.776	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0042645	{PloS one (2.776): 10.1371/journal.pone.0042645}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA150943	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA150943	None	[Overal design]The fully-sequenced human fecal isolate of B.theta (VPI-5482) was grown on Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) agar and in BHI broth under strict anaerobic conditions using pre-reduced media.

GSE113751	Homo sapiens	34	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Translational control through differential ribosome pausing during amino acid limitation in mammalian cells	2018-04-27	Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that limitation for the amino acid arginine causes a selective loss of tRNA charging, which regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Interestingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation led to loss of arginine tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Codon-specific ribosome pausing decreased protein production and triggered premature ribosome termination without significantly reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids which are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on synonymous codon usage.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113751	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.041	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.041}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA453915	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA453915	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP143452	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling was performed in HEK293T, HCT116, or HeLa cells during limitation for leucine or arginine for 3 or 6 hours to determine the effect of limiting single amino acid levels of ribosome elongation kinetics at the cognate codons.

We further develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure. Together, these findings significantly extend our understanding of how the “cancerous” translation machinery steers specific cancer cell behaviors and may be therapeutically targeted.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE35469	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10912	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature10912}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA152347	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA152347	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP010679	[Overal design]Examination of mRNA translation in human prostate cancer upon differential inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'PC3 cells were treated with rapamycin (50 nM - Calbiochem) or PP242 (2.5 µM - Intellikine) for 3 hours.

Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide production beyond annotated genes, including induction of immune responses following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Translation is pervasive on cytosolic transcripts outside of conserved reading frames, and direct detection of this expanded universe of translated products enables efforts to understand how cells manage and exploit its consequences.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60095	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.07.045	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.07.045}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA257463	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA257463	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP045257	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling to verify that true ribosome footprints shift in response to different elongation inhibitors (CHX vs Emetine) and co-purify with an affinity-tagged large ribosomal subunit (bound vs input); [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction\nRNA extraction with Trizol, preadenylated linker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification', 'Rnase I footprinting, size exclusion chromatography, RNA extraction\nRNA extraction with Trizol, preadenylated linker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification', 'Rnase I footprinting, size exclusion chromatography, streptavidin affinity purification of assembled 80S ribosomes by large subunit affinity tag\nRNA extraction with Trizol, preadenylated linker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification'; [Cell type]'Source: ''treatment: ES cell feeder-free, w/ LIF 60 s CYH (100 ug/ml); genetic background: 129/Ola; cell line: E14; growth protocol: Feeder-free, with LIF; ', 'treatment: ES cell feeder-free, w/ LIF 60 s Emetine; genetic background: 129/Ola; cell line: E14; growth protocol: Feeder-free, with LIF; ', 'treatment: DMEM + 10% FBS; cell line: HEK; '

To investigate RNA tails at the genomic scale, we previously developed TAIL-seq, but its low sensitivity precluded its application to biological materials of minute quantity. In this study, we report a new version of TAILseq (mRNA TAIL-seq or mTAIL-seq) with enhanced sequencing depth for mRNAs (by ~1000 fold compared to the previous version). The improved method allows us to investigate the regulation of poly(A) tail in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs are polyadenylated mainly during late oogenesis, prior to fertilization, and that further modulation occurs upon egg activation. Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase, adenylates the vast majority of maternal mRNAs with a few intriguing exceptions such as ribosomal protein transcripts. By comparing mTAILseq data with ribosome profiling data, we find a strong coupling between poly(A) tail length and translational efficiency during egg activation. Our data suggest that regulation of poly(A) tail in oocytes shapes the translatomic landscape of embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development. By virtue of the high sensitivity, low cost, technical robustness, and broad accessibility, mTAIL-seq will be a potent tool to improve our understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse biological systems.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83731	Genes & development	8.99	https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.284802.116	{Genes & development (8.990): 10.1101/gad.284802.116}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA326884	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA326884	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP077234	[Overal design]Ten separate sets of TAIL-seq experiments were performed.

We profiled 2 representative estrogen receptor-positive (T47D and ZR75-1) and 2 representative triple negative (SUM159PT and MDA-MB-231) cell lines. Translational profiles of a nonmalignant (Human Mammary Epithelial Cells, HMECs) and a nontumorigenic (MCF10A cells) counterparts were also analyzed. We analyzed and compared translational efficiencies, variances of the translational efficiencies, differential gene and transcript expression between malignant and non-malignant cell lines. We performed discriminative motif analysis of the 5'untranslated regions of the transcripts that are commonly transcribed in nonmalignant and malignant cells but preferentially translated in malignant cells and identified common motifs. Some of these motifs are highly similar to the RNA binding motifs of a small list of RNA interacting proteins.

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The impact of posttranslational modifications has not yet been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging since individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). Here, we develop polysome proteome profiling to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. Our method combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on the fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12/uL11 -- a known mitotic CDK1 substrate -- is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12/uL11 phosphorylation regulates translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis. Together, our results show that posttranslational modification of ribosomal proteins can regulate translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112186	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.08.019	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2018.08.019}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA445182	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA445182	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP136214	"[Overal design]Gene expression profiling of immunoprecipitated RPL12 protein-RNA complexes; [Treatment]'RPL12 wild-type, S38A or S38D mutant coding sequences were recombined using LR Clonase II (Gateway, Thermo Fischer Scientific) into pFRT/TO/FLAG/HA-DEST (Addgene ID: 26360).

GSE99395	Toxoplasma gondii	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16774	Comparative ribosome profiling uncovers a dominant role for translational control in Toxoplasma gondii	2017-05-30	The lytic cycle of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which involves a brief sojourn in the extracellular space, is characterized by defined transcriptional profiles. For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. Unlike transcriptional profiles, insights into genome-wide translational profiles of Toxoplasma gondii are lacking. We have performed genome-wide ribosome profiling, coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, in intracellular and extracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites to investigate translational control during the lytic cycle. Results: Although differences in transcript abundance were mostly mirrored at the translational level, we observed significant differences in the abundance of ribosome footprints between the two parasite stages. Furthermore, our data suggest that mRNA translation in the parasite is potentially regulated by mRNA secondary structure and upstream open reading frames.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99395	BMC genomics	3.501	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4362-6	{BMC genomics (3.501): 10.1186/s12864-017-4362-6}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA388385	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA388385	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP108243	"[Overal design]We compared ribosome footprints in intracellular and extracellular parasites.; [Treatment]'Prior to havesting, the parasite cultures were treated for about 10min with cyclohexamide (100ug/ml).'; [Growth]'Type I Toxoplasma gondii was grown on human foreskin fibroblasts and intracellular or extracellular parasites collected after 24 hrs'; [Extraction]""Aftter collection, the parasite samples were divided into two samples: one sample was used for ribosome profling, as previously described (Ingolia et al, 2009) and the other sample was used for high throughput RNA-sequencing.\nLibraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions.

Here, we characterized immune-responsive long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and determined their subcellular localization and co-sedimentation with protein complexes in primary human macrophages. To this end, we profiled LPS-responsive lncRNAs, isolated cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA fractions from mock- and LPS-treated cells and seperated cell lysates on 10-60 % glycerol gradients, followed by gradient fractionation. All samples were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. LPS-responsive lncRNAs were found to be mostly cytoplasmic. Glycerol gradient datasets revealed that a substantial fraction of LPS-responsive lncRNAs, similar to mRNAs, co-sediments with ribosomal RNAs and also ribosomal proteins, as confirmed by mass-spectrometry analysis. LncRNAs not co-sedimenting with ribosomes displayed a highly heterogenous gradient distriubtion. Among these truly non-coding RNAs we identified lncRNA MaIL1 as a novel element of the macrophage TLR-TRIF signaling pathway contributing to antibacterial defense.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE101409	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	9.58	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920393117	{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (9.580): 10.1073/pnas.1920393117}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA394134	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA394134	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP111854	"[Overal design]Expression profiles of poly(A)-RNA from primary human macrophages (+/- LPS treatment) or subcellular macrophage fractions (+/- LPS treatment) were recorded in experimental replicates.

GSE141459	Homo sapiens	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL16791	ZAK activation on colliding ribosomes triggers SAPK signaling pathways to regulate cell fate	2019-12-04	Problems arising during translation of mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling and collisions with trailing ribosomes. These collisions are known to trigger a series of events including degradation of the stalled nascent polypeptide, decay of the problematic mRNAs, and ribosome rescue. However, the systemic cellular response of ribosome collision has not been explored. Here, we uncover a novel function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using multiple translation elongation inhibitors and cellular stress conditions, we show that ribosome collisions activate both the SAPK (Stress Activated Protein Kinase) and GCN2-mediated cellular stress response pathways that lead to apoptosis and the integrated stress response (ISR), respectively. We further show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions, and ZAK is required for activation of both SAPKs p38/JNK and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that ZAK preferentially associates with the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome, inducing ZAK phosphorylation. While ZAK associates with elongating ribosomes under non-stressed conditions, activation of ZAK is specifically trigger by colliding ribosomes. Together, these results provide new insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis, as read-out by colliding ribosomes, regulates cell fate.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141459	Cell	36.216	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.006	{Cell (36.216): 10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.006}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA593553	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA593553	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP234715	[Overal design]4 samples for selective ribosome profiling experiments using ZAK OE HeLa cells. 4 samples for ribosome profiling experiments using HeLa cells.; [Treatment]'Expression of ZAK-FLAG was induced by addition of Doxycycline for 24 hr.', 'Monosomes were isolated by sucrose pelleting after RNaseI treatment'; [Growth]'Cells were grown to 75% confluency'; [Extraction]'Monosomes or disomes were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation after RNaseI treatment and subjected to immunoprecipitation\nFragments ranging from 24-90 nt  were gel purified for monosome or disome footprints, respectively. rRNA was depleted from this pool through Ribo-Zero Gold treatment.

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but not transcriptional dysfunction. These results extend our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of TSC brain lesions, and suggest phenotype-tailored pharmacological treatment strategies.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78960	Genome medicine	10.886	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-016-0347-3	{Genome medicine (10.886): 10.1186/s13073-016-0347-3}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA314507	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA314507	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP071235	[Overal design]Rapamycin, AZD-8055, and DMSO were given to two TSC+/+ cell lines and two TSC-/- cell lines after six weeks of differentiation.

GSE148536	Mus musculus	12	Other	GPL21626	Ythdf m6A readers compensate each other in a context dependent manner [Ribo-seq]	2020-04-12	YTH domain family proteins Ythdf1, Ythdf2, Ythdf3 are three readers with highly similar structure, which were shown to have different roles in the cell. However, their similarity and the fact that they tend to bind the same targets suggest that in some cases they may have an overlapping role. In this paper, we systematically knocked-out (KO) each of the three readers and the three together (triple-KO), and estimated the effect in-vitro in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and in-vivo, in viability and gametogenesis. We show that in mESCs there is a compensation between the three readers, with a dramatic hyper-pluripotent phenotype only in the triple-KO. However, in-vivo, Ythdf2 has a dominant role that cannot be compensated by Ythdf1 or Ythdf3, both in viability of the mouse pups and in gametogenesis. We suggest that compensation is dosage-dependent, and in-vivo we cannot detect it due to difference in the readers’ expression, both in level and in spatial location. In addition, we found that Ythdf1 and Ythdf3 specifically down-regulate 2-cell genes, that Ythdf2-KO in gametogenesis affects microtubuline related genes, and that Mettl3-KO severity is increased as the deletion occurs earlier in gametogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148536	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA624906	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA624906	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP256256	[Overal design]Mouse embryonic stem cells were knocked-out to each of the following proteins: Mettl3, Ythdf1, Ythdf2, Ythdf3, and Ythdf1/2/3 triple-KO.

Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5′ terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158374	bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology	None	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.295493	{bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology (None): 10.1101/2020.09.13.295493}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA665035	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA665035	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP284977	[Overal design]Effects of NSP1 and NSP2 expression in translation and transcription in HEK293 cells; [Treatment]'pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-nsp1-2XStrep-IRES-Puro plasmid (Addgene, 141367), pLVXEF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-nsp2-2XStrep-IRES-Puro plasmid (Addgene, 141368) and pLVXEF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-N-2XStrep-IRES-Puro (Addgene, 141391) were obtained from Addgene.

GSE154488	Candida albicans	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL27827	Global Translational Landscape of the Candida albicans Morphological Transition	2020-07-15	Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen that represents the fourth leading cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the U.S. and is associated with high mortality and/or morbidity rates in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including cancer and AIDS patients. While the C. albicans morphological transition from yeast to filamentous cells is required for virulence, considerably little is known about translational mechanisms important for controlling this transition as well as other virulence-related processes in C. albicans and other human fungal pathogens. Using ribosome profiling, we report the first global translational profile associated with C. albicans morphogenesis. Strikingly, many genes involved in pathogenesis, filamentation, response to stress and cell wall organization show reduced translational efficiency (TE). Several of these genes are known to be strongly induced at the transcriptional level, suggesting that a translational fine-tuning mechanism is in place. Using a recently developed ORF-calling method, we have identified a significant number of potential uORFs in genes associated with pathogenesis and at least 57 potential novel ORFs, several of which appear to show altered TE in response to filamentation. Finally, using a novel method for global analysis of ribosome pausing from Ribo-seq data, we demonstrate an enrichment of ribosome pausing sites in C. albicans genes associated with protein synthesis and cell wall functions. Altogether, our results suggest that the C. albicans morphological transition is associated with widespread global translational alterations that do not simply reflect transcriptional changes and affect the expression of many genes associated with virulence-related processes and pathogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154488	G3 (Bethesda, Md.)	2.63	https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaa043	{G3 (Bethesda, Md.)

In human gliomas, rapidly proliferating Olig2+ cells resembling OPCs are frequently observed. We sought to identify, in vivo, candidate pathways uniquely required for OPC differentiation or quiescence. Using the bacTRAP methodology, we generated and analyzed mouse lines for translational profiling the major cells types (including OPCs), in the normal mouse brain. We then profiled oligodendoglial (Olig2+) cells from a mouse model of Pdgf-driven glioma.

GSE21983	Homo sapiens	72	Expression profiling by array	GPL6106	The discovery and validation of ten-gene prognostic classifier in gastric cancer by whole genome expression profiling	2010-05-25	The aim of this study is to identify and verify a prognosis set that is able to distinguish patient overall survival status based on whole genome expression profiling. Using Illumina HumanWG-6 beadarray, we analyzed the expression of 47,296 transcripts in two groups of gastric cancer patients who all underwent surgical resection. Thirty-nine of 46 samples in group one were used as a training set to discover candidates for overall survival prediction by using semi-supervised method, resulting in a panel of 10 genes as prognosis markers. This 10-marker set classified each case into a low or a high risk group with significantly different survival times (P = 0.000047) and maintained independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. These 10 candidates were then verified in a fully independent validation set comprising 33 samples (P = 0.0009). Furthermore, the prognosis was consistent with the classical TNM staging system, and showed even better prediction. Interestingly, six of ten survival markers are ribosomal proteins, suggesting a possible association between deregulation of ribosome-related expression and poor prognosis. In conclusion, by whole genome expression profiling, 10 markers, including 6 ribosomal proteins, for overall survival prognosis of gastric cancer were found and validated, and which may be parallelly used with the TNM system.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21983	World journal of gastroenterology	3.411	https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v17.i13.1710	{World journal of gastroenterology (3.411): 10.3748/wjg.v17.i13.1710}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA127195	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA127195	None	[Overal design]We investigated the transcriptome profiles of gastric cancer patients with different prognosis.

GSE153945	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL17342	Persistent activation of mRNA translation by transient Hsp90 inhibition	2020-07-07	The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone functions as a protein-folding buffer and plays a unique role promoting the evolution of new heritable traits. To better understand how Hsp90 can affect mRNA translation we screened more than 1600 factors involved in mRNA regulation for physical interactions with Hsp90 in human cells. The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persisted for 30 generations after the inhibitor was removed. Ribosomal profiling revealed that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, transient loss of Hsp90 function can promote a non-genetic inheritance of a translational state affecting specific mRNAs, introducing a new mechanism by which Hsp90 can promote phenotypic variation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153945	None	None	None	None	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA644594	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA644594	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP270667	[Overal design]Ribosome-profiling data examining heat shock and Hsp90 inhibition in yeast.; [Treatment]'10uM radicicol treatment o/n prior to further diliution to 0.001 OD600 and an additional o/n growth'; [Growth]'Three individual yeast colonies were picked and grown o/n in liquid culture.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21992	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09267	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature09267}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA129385	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA129385	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP002605	"[Overal design]Examine ribosome footprints and mRNA abundance of HeLa cells transfected with miR-1 or miR-155, versus mock-transfected cells, at two different time points post-transfection.

GSE35659	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by array	GPL570	A transcriptional map of the impact of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle phenotype (resting muscle after endurance training)	2012-02-09	The molecular pathways which are activated and contribute to physiological remodeling of skeletal muscle in response to endurance exercise have not been fully characterized. We previously reported that ~800 gene transcripts are regulated following 6 weeks of supervised endurance training in young sedentary males, referred to as the training responsive transcriptome (TRT). Here we utilized this database together with data on biological variation in muscle adaptation to aerobic endurance training in both humans and a novel out-bred rodent model to study the potential regulatory molecules that coordinate this complex network of genes. We identified three DNA sequences representing RUNX1, SOX9, and PAX3 transcription factor binding sites as over-represented in the TRT. In turn, miRNA profiling indicated that several miRNAs targeting RUNX1, SOX9 and PAX3 were down-regulated by endurance training. The TRT was then examined by contrasting subjects who demonstrated the least vs. the greatest improvement in aerobic capacity (low vs. high responders), and at least 100 of the 800 TRT genes were differentially regulated, thus suggesting regulation of these genes may be important for improving aerobic capacity. In high responders, pro-angiogenic and tissue developmental networks emerged as key candidates for coordinating tissue aerobic adaptation. Beyond RNA level validation there were several DNA variants that associated with VO(2)max trainability in the HERITAGE Family Study but these did not pass conservative Bonferroni adjustment. In addition, in a rat model selected across 10 generations for high aerobic training responsiveness, we found that both the TRT and a homologous subset of the human high responder genes were regulated to a greater degree in high responder rodent skeletal muscle. This analysis provides a comprehensive map of the transcriptomic features important for aerobic exercise-induced improvements in maximal oxygen consumption.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE35659	Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)	3.14	https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00634.2010	{Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985) (3.140): 10.1152/japplphysiol.00634.2010}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA155863	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA155863	None	[Overal design]This data is from skeletal muscle post 6 weeks of endurance exercise training matching the samples (pre-training, fasting) provided in GSE18583; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'skeletal muscle post 6 weeks of endurance exercise training'; [Extraction]'Muscle was homogenised in Trizol with Polytron motor driven homogeniser and RNA extraction carried out using Trizol protocol (Invitrogen).

To identify new regulators of erythropoiesis, we performed a functional genomic screen for genes affecting expression of the erythroid marker CD235a/GYPA. Among validating hits were genes coding for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) complex, including, METTL14, METTL3, and WTAP. We found that m6A MTase activity promotes erythroid gene expression programs through selective translation of ~300 m6A marked mRNAs, including those coding for SETD histone methyltransferases, ribosomal components, and polyA RNA binding proteins, and novel genes. Remarkably, loss of m6A marks resulted in dramatic loss of H3K4me3 marks across key erythroid-specific KLF1 transcriptional targets (e.g., Heme biosynthesis genes). Further, each m6A MTase subunit and a subset of their mRNAs targets are required for human erythroid specification in primary bone-marrow derived progenitors. Thus, m6A mRNA marks promote the translation of a network of genes required for human erythropoiesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE105782	Nature communications	11.878	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12518-6	{Nature communications (11.878): 10.1038/s41467-019-12518-6}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA415390	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA415390	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP120964	[Overal design]Contains three replicates of ribosome protected RNA samples and total input RNA from non-targeting control sgRNA HEL cells and WTAP sgRNA KO HEL cells; [Treatment]'Cells were treated with puromycin to kill untransduced cells at the start of the experiement'; [Growth]'Cells were cultured in RPMI+10% FBS at 37C 5% CO2'; [Extraction]'RNA/protein were extracted following the protocol in the TruSeq Ribo Profile kit from Illumina\nRNA libraries were prepared for sequencing following the protocol in the TruSeq Ribo Profile kit from Illumina'; [Cell type]'HEL cells''cell type: HEL cells; fraction: RPF RNA; ', 'cell type: HEL cells; fraction: total RNA; '

Existing approaches make use of sequence fragment length or frame occupancy to differentiate between active translation and background noise, however they do not consider additional characteristics inherent to the technology which limits their overall accuracy. Here, we present an analytical tool that models the overall tri-nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence. Our software, SPECtre, examines the relationship of normalized ribosome profiling read coverage over a rolling series of windows along a transcript against an idealized reference signal. A comparison of SPECtre against current methods on existing and new data shows a marked improvement in accuracy for detecting active translation and exhibits overall high sensitivity at a low false discovery rate.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75947	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA305807	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA305807	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP067300	[Overal design]Classification of actively translated transcripts in ribosome profiling data derived from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and data previously published derived from mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish embryos.; [Treatment]'Cells were washed with PBS supplemented with cycloheximide (100ug/ml), then flash frozen and lysed on plate in the presence of cycloheximide in 500uL of ice-cold lysis buffer.'; [Growth]'The neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were plated on 140mm dishes and allowed to propagate to 80% confluency.'; [Extraction]'Lysates from two plates were combined, RNase I treated, and the ribosome fraction of 300uL of lysate was extracted with a 1M sucrose cushion and high speed centrifugation.\nRNA footprints in the range of 26-34nt were gel extracted, rRNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina), and the remaining RNA served as the template for constructing the amplified cDNA library.

GSE79664	Homo sapiens	18	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	Regulation of poly(A) tail and translation during the somatic cell cycle	2016-03-28	Poly(A) tails are critical for mRNA stability and translation. However, recent studies have challenged this view, showing that poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency are decoupled in non-embryonic cells. Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. We also find that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translation when the poly(A) tail is <20 nucleotides. However, as most genes have >20 nucleotide poly(A) tails, their translation is regulated mainly via poly(A) tail length-independent mechanisms during the cell cycle. Specifically, we find that terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract-containing transcripts escape global translational suppression in M phase and are actively translated. Our quantitative and comprehensive data provide a revised view of translational control in the somatic cell cycle.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79664	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.04.007	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2016.04.007}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA316618	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA316618	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP072459	[Overal design]HeLa cells were synchronized at S or M phase, and subject to RNA-seq, ribosome profiling and TAIL-seq analysis.; [Treatment]'For S phase-arrest, cells were arrested by 2 mM thymidine for 18 hr and then released into fresh medium for 9 hr, which was followed by second thymidine block for 17 hr.

GSE74139	Mus musculus	37	Other	GPL17021	A regression-based analysis of ribosome-profiling data reveals a conserved complexity to mammalian translation	2015-10-19	A fundamental goal of genomics is to identify the complete set of expressed proteins. Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions about protein-coding sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not overlap, and exceed a minimum length. However, an increasing number of newly discovered proteins violate these rules. Here we present an experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome profiling and linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification of translation. Application of this approach to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells and HCMV-infected human fibroblasts identifies thousands of novel CDSs, including micropeptides and variants of known proteins, that bear the hallmarks of canonical translation and exhibit comparable translation levels and dynamics to annotated CDSs. Remarkably, many translation events are identified in both mouse and human cells even when the peptide sequence is not conserved. Our work thus reveals an unexpected complexity to mammalian translation suited to provide both conserved regulatory or protein-based functions.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74139	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.11.013	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2015.11.013}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA299160	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA299160	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP064972	[Overal design]37 ribosome footprint samples from mouse BMDCs across a time course of LPS stimulation and in the presence or absence of translation inhibitors cycloheximide, harringtonine, or lactimidomycin.

METTL3 can promote translation but the mechanism and widespread relevance remain unknown. Here we show that METTL3 enhances translation only when tethered to reporter mRNA at sites close to the stop codon supporting a mRNA looping mechanism for ribosome recycling and translational control. Electron microscopy revealed the topology of individual polyribosomes with single METTL3 foci found in close proximity to 5’ cap-binding proteins. We identify a direct physical and functional interaction between METTL3 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit h (eIF3h). METTL3 promotes translation of a large subset of oncogenic mRNAs, including BRD4 that are also m6A-modified in human primary lung tumors. The METTL3-eIF3h interaction is required for enhanced translation, formation of densely packed polyribosomes, and oncogenic transformation. METTL3 depletion inhibits tumorigenicity and sensitizes lung cancer cells to BRD4 inhibition. These findings uncover a mRNA looping mechanism of translation control and identify METTL3-eIF3h as a potential cancer therapeutic target.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117299	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0538-8	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/s41586-018-0538-8}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA481680	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA481680	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP154311	"[Overal design]METTL3 expression was depleted in HeLa cells using lentivirus mediated shRNA knockdown.

Here, we describe the age-specific and brain-region-specific accumulation of ribosome-associated 3' UTR RNAs that lack the 5' UTR and open reading frame. Our study reveals this phenomenon impacts hundreds of genes in aged D1 spiny projection neurons of the mouse striatum and also occurs in the aging human brain. Isolated 3' UTR accumulation is tightly correlated with mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative stress, with full-length mRNA expression that is reduced but not eliminated and with production of short 3' UTR-encoded peptides. Depletion of the oxidation-sensitive Fe-S cluster ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 induces the accumulation of 3' UTRs, consistent with a model in which ribosome stalling and mRNA cleavage by No-Go decay yields isolated 3' UTR RNAs protected by ribosomes. Isolated 3' UTR accumulation is a hallmark of brain aging, likely reflecting regional differences in metabolism and oxidative stress.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97461	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.10.094	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.10.094}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA381914	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA381914	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP103213	[Overal design]sequencing of TRAP isolated cell-type specific mRNA from D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons in aged and young mice. 4 Biological replicates per condition.

GSE59983	Homo sapiens	76	Expression profiling by array	GPL13158	Gene expression profiling of primary human retinoblastoma	2014-07-31	Background Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye cancer associated with RB1 loss or MYCN amplification (RB1+/+MYCNA). There are controversies concerning the existence of molecular subtypes within RB1-/- retinoblastoma. To test whether these molecular subtypes exist, we performed molecular profiling. Methods Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling was performed on 76 primary human retinoblastomas. Expression profiling was complemented by genome-wide DNA profiling and clinical, histopathological, and ex vivo drug sensitivity data. Findings RNA and DNA profiling identified major variability between retinoblastomas. While gene expression differences between RB1+/+MYCNA and RB1-/- tumors seemed more dichotomous, differences within the RB1-/- tumors were gradual. Tumors with high expression of a photoreceptor gene signature were highly differentiated, smaller in volume and diagnosed at younger age compared to tumors with low photoreceptor signature expression. Tumors with lower photoreceptor expression showed increased expression of genes involved in M-phase and mRNA and ribosome synthesis and increased frequencies of somatic copy number alterations. Interpretation Molecular, clinical and histopathological differences between RB1-/- tumors are best explained by tumor progression, reflected by a gradual loss of differentiation and photoreceptor expression signature. Since copy number alterations were more frequent in tumors with less photoreceptorness, genomic alterations might be drivers of tumor progression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59983	EBioMedicine	6.68	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.06.022	{EBioMedicine (6.680): 10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.06.022}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA257212	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA257212	None	"[Overal design]Fresh frozen material from 76 primary human retinoblastoma samples were profiled with Affymetrix human genome u133 plus 2.0 PM microarray; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]""Frozen tumour samples were homogenized in Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Canada) with a rotor-stator homogenizer, and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions.

We present a protocol for genome-wide, quantitative analysis of in vivo translation by deep sequencing. This ribosome profiling approach maps the exact positions of ribosomes on transcripts by nuclease footprinting. The nuclease-protected mRNA fragments are converted into a DNA library suitable for deep sequencing using a strategy that minimizes bias. The abundance of different footprint fragments in deep sequencing data reports on the amount of translation of a gene. Additionally, footprints reveal the exact regions of the transcriptome that are translated. To better define translated reading frames, we describe an adaptation that reveals the sites of translation initiation by pre-treating cells with harringtonine to immobilize initiating ribosomes.

We used multiple elongation inhibitors and chemical probing to define ribosome conformational states corresponding to different sized ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) generated by ribosome profiling. We show using various genetic and environmental perturbations that the previously identified 20-22 nucleotide (nt) RPFs correspond predominantly to ribosomes in a pre-accommodation state with an open 40S ribosomal A site while the classical 27-29 nt fragments correspond to ribosomes in a pre-translocation state with an occupied 40S ribosomal A site. These distinct ribosome conformational states revealed by ribosome profiling are seen in all eukaryotes tested including fungi, worms and mammals. This high-resolution ribosome profiling approach reveals the anticipated Rck2-dependent inhibition of translocation through eEF2 phosphorylation during hyperosmotic stress. These same approaches reveal a strong translation elongation arrest during oxidative stress where the ribosomes are trapped in a pre-translocation state, but in this case the translational arrest is independent of Rck2-driven eEF2 phosphorylation. These results provide new insights and approaches for defining the molecular events that impact translation elongation throughout biology.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE115161	The EMBO journal	11.227	https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2019103365	{The EMBO journal (11.227): 10.15252/embj.2019103365}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA473989	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA473989	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP149446	[Overal design]24 biological samples are included for ribosome footprinting samples.

We applied our method to human lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 7,863 previously unannotated coding sequences, including 445 translated sequences in pseudogenes and 2,442 translated upstream open reading frames. We observed an enrichment of harringtonine-treated ribosome footprints at the inferred initiation sites, validating many of the novel coding sequences. In aggregate, the novel sequences exhibit significant signatures of purifying selection indicative of protein-coding function, suggesting that many of the novel sequences are functional. We observed that nearly 40% of bicistronic transcripts showed significant negative correlation in the levels of translation of their two coding sequences, suggesting a key regulatory role for these novel translated sequences. Despite evidence for their functional importance, the novel peptide sequences were detected by mass spectrometry at a lower rate than predicted based on data from annotated proteins, thus suggesting that many of the novel peptide products may be relatively short-lived. Our work illustrates the value of ribosome profiling for improving coding annotations, and significantly expands the set of known coding regions.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75290	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13328	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.13328}	'cytoplasmic RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA303958	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA303958	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP066598	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling assays were performed on cell lines treated with Harringtonine to generate data for validating translation initiatoin site prediction; [Treatment]'Each culture was treated with 2 μg/ml harringtonine (final concentration in media) for 2 minutes followed by 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (final concentration in media).'; [Growth]'Cells were cultured at 37 degree Celsius and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine and 15% fetal bovine serum)'; [Extraction]'Ribosome footprint profiling experiments were performed using ARTseqTM Ribosome Profiling kit for mammalian cells (RPHMR12126) following vendor’s instructions.

It contains seven CCHC-type zinc-finger domains and was suggested to act as a nucleic acid chaperone, as well as a transcription factor. Here, we identify all CNBP isoforms as cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins. Using Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside Enhanced Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation, we mapped its binding sites on RNA at nucleotide-level resolution on a genome-wide scale and find that CNBP interacted with 3961 mRNAs in human cell lines, preferentially at a G-rich motif close to the AUG start codon on mature mRNAs. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses coupled with system-wide RNA and protein quantification revealed that CNBP did not affect RNA abundance, but rather promoted translation of its targets. This is consistent with an RNA chaperone function of CNBP helping to resolve secondary structures, thus promoting translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93052	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA359690	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA359690	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP095901	[Overal design]CNBP protein knockout and Ribosome profiling; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'HEK293 cells were grown and routinely passaged in DMEM with 10% FCS and 1% pen/strip.'; [Extraction]'The riboseq library was generated using NEB ultradirectional library preparation kit as per manufacturers protocol.\nRibosome profiling'; [Cell type]'Source: ', 'CRISPR-cas9 mediated CNBP knockout''treatment: Harringtonine-Chyclohexamide treated; cell line: HEK293; ', 'treatment: Cyclohexamide treated; cell line: HEK293; ', 'cell type: CRISPR-cas9 mediated CNBP knockout; treatment: Harringtonine-Chyclohexamide treated; cell line: HEK293; ', 'cell type: CRISPR-cas9 mediated CNBP knockout; treatment: Cyclohexamide treated; cell line: HEK293; '

Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved mechanisms that lead to the degradation of the faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptide. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Both model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation of faulty mRNAs, and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides, could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153597	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.007	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.007}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA643292	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA643292	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP269441	[Overal design]This datasets consists of paired ribosome profiling and RNA-seq datasets collected in replicate after the CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of NEMF, ZNF598, EIF4E2, GIGYF2, and non-targeting negative controls.; [Treatment]'K562-dCas9 cell line stably expressing GFPNon-stop was infected with lentiviral vectors containing a guide RNA against one gene or non-targeting guide RNA (Table 2).

GSE95024	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	p53-induced apoptosis is specified by a translation program regulated by PCBP2 and DHX30.	2017-02-17	Activation of p53 by the small molecule Nutlin can result in a combination of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The relative strength of these events is difficult to predict, leaving uncertainty as to the therapeutic benefits of Nutlin. Here, we report a new translation control mechanism shaping p53-dependent apoptosis. We performed polysomal profiling in the cell lines SJSA1 and HCT116, of which only the first undergoes robust cell death in response to p53 activation by Nutlin. We establish Nutlin-induced apoptosis in SJSA1 cells to be associated with a set of translationally enhanced mRNAs carrying a newly identified 3’UTR motif which we labeled CG-motif. We identified PCBP2 and DHX30 as interactor proteins of the CG-motif that are more abundant in HCT116 cells compared to SJSA1. The binding of DHX30 to the CG-motif detected in HCT116 cells was shown to be dependent on PCBP2. Interestingly, DHX30 depletion enhances polysome association of CG-motif mRNAs in HCT116 cells, shifting their outcome towards apoptosis. In U2OS, an osteosarcoma-derived cell line that unlike SJSA1 undergoes persistent cell cycle arrest in response to Nutlin, DHX30 is highly expressed and its depletion enhances the expression of CG-motif mRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95024	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.011	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.011}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA375753	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA375753	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP100158	[Overal design]4 biological samples per condition are used.

GSE105082	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL18573	RNA G-quadruplexes mark repressive upstream open reading frames in human mRNAs	2017-10-17	Translational control is a key determinant of protein abundance, which in turns defines the physiology and pathology of human cells. Initiation of translation is highly regulated in eukaryotes and is considered as the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis. mRNA secondary structures in 5’ untranslated region (UTR) and associated helicases have been characterised as key determinants of translation initiation. Nevertheless the transcriptome-wide contribution of non-canonical secondary structures, such as RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s), to the translation of human mRNAs remains largely unappreciated. Here we use a ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape associated to rG4s-containing mRNAs and the contribution of two rG4s-specialised DExH-box helicases, DHX9 and DHX36, to translation initiation in human cells. We show that rG4-forming sequences in 5’-UTR is associated with decreased translation efficiency which correlate with an increased ribosome density within the 5’-UTRs. We found that rG4s contribute to the translation of upstream open reading frames, and as a consequence, thwart the translation of the associated protein coding sequences (CDS). Depletion of the DHX36 and DHX9 helicases demonstrated that the formation of the rG4 structural motif rather than its nucleotide sequence mediate translation initiation. Our findings unveil a role for non-canonical structures in defining alternative 5’ starts for human mRNAs translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE105082	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1602-2	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-018-1602-2}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA414611	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA414611	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP120157	[Overal design]11 Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq matched samples; 1 iCLIP libraries containing two barcoded replicates; [Treatment]'For siRNA transfection, 5 × 10^6 HeLa cells per 15 cm dish were cultured overnight and treated with 27 μL DharmaFECT 1 Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon) and treated with 90 nM indicated siRNA in 1.8 mL OptiMEM media.DHX9 and DHX36 siRNA oligoes were transfected at equimolar concentrations.

GSE13176	Candida albicans	12	Expression profiling by array	GPL7476	The protein kinase Tor1 regulates adhesin expression in Candida albicans	2008-10-13	Eukaryotic cell growth is coordinated in response to nutrient availability, growth factors, and environmental stimuli, enabling cell–cell interactions that promote survival. The rapamycin-sensitive Tor1 protein kinase, which is conserved from yeasts to humans, participates in a signaling pathway central to cellular nutrient responses. To gain insight into Tor-mediated processes in human fungal pathogens, we have characterized Tor signaling in Candida albicans. Global transcriptional profiling revealed evolutionarily conserved roles for Tor1 in regulating the expression of genes involved in nitrogen starvation responses and ribosome biogenesis. Interestingly, we found that in C. albicans Tor1 plays a novel role in regulating the expression of several cell wall and hyphal specific genes, including adhesins and their transcriptional repressors Nrg1 and Tup1. In accord with this transcriptional profile, rapamycin induced extensive cellular aggregation in an adhesin-dependent fashion. Moreover, adhesin gene induction and cellular aggregation of rapamycin-treated cells were strongly dependent on the transactivators Bcr1 and Efg1. These findings support models in which Tor1 negatively controls cellular adhesion by governing the activities of Bcr1 and Efg1. Taken together, these results provide evidence that Tor1-mediated cellular adhesion might be broadly conserved among eukaryotic organisms.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13176	PLoS pathogens	6.463	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000294	{PLoS pathogens (6.463): 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000294}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA109719	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA109719	None	[Overal design]Study consists of wild type Candida albicans cells grown in Spider liquid medium at 35C and treated either with vehicle or 20 nM rapamycin.

From within the parasitophorous vacuole in which they reside, Toxoplasma tachyzoites secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that can reprogram host gene expression to facilitate parasite survival and replication. Gaining a better understanding of how host gene expression is altered upon infection is central for understanding parasite strategies for host invasion and for developing new parasite therapies. Here, we applied ribosome profiling coupled with mRNA measurements to concurrently study gene expression in the parasite and in host human foreskin fibroblasts. By examining the parasite transcriptome and translatome, we identified potential upstream open reading frames that may permit the stress-induced preferential translation of parasite mRNAs. We also determined that tachyzoites reduce host death-associated pathways and increase survival, proliferation, and motility in both quiescent and proliferative host cell models of infection. Additionally, proliferative cells alter their gene expression in ways consistent with massive transcriptional rewiring while quiescent cells were best characterized by re-entry into the cell cycle. We also identified a translational control regimen consistent with mTOR activation in quiescent cells, and to a lesser degree in proliferative cells. This study illustrates the utility of the method for dissection of gene expression programs simultaneously in parasite and host.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE129869	mSphere	4.447	https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00292-19	{mSphere (4.447): 10.1128/mSphere.00292-19}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA533074	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA533074	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP192707	"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of Toxoplasma-infected confluent and subconfluent human foreskin fibroblasts in triplicate; [Treatment]'HFFs were split, allowed to grow for 24 hours then infected with RH strain T. gondii for 24 hours in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS w/o antibiotic'; [Growth]'parasites routinely subcultured in HFFs in DMEM supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS w/o antibiotic; HFFs routinely subcultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS w/o antibiotics'; [Extraction]""cytoplasmic lysate was collected and an aliquot was immediately stored in Trizol for RNA-seq samples.

Measures of transcriptional mRNA levels may therefore misrepresent cellular activation. To test this hypothesis employing human physiological mRNA levels, we analyzed cytoplasmic and polyribosome-bound mRNA expression (Frac-seq) combined with microRNA profiling by small RNA-seq in bronchoepithelial cells from healthy and severe asthma (SA) donors, SA being a chronic inflammatory airways disease, poorly understood at the molecular level. We found 275 genes bound to polyribosomes differentially between healthy and severe asthma, of which only 11.64% overlapped with differentially expressed cytoplasmic mRNAs (226 genes). We found 335 alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms differentially bound to polyribosomes of which only ~8% were revealed by cytoplasmic mRNA analysis. Approximately two thirds of differentially expressed isoforms could not be found at the gene level in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound fractions, demonstrating the disruption of splicing in asthma. Only the analysis of differentially expressed isoforms bound to polyribosomes revealed disease-related pathways overlooked in total mRNA. We detected a network of 21 microRNAs differentially expressed, with 8 microRNAs accounting for more than 80% targeting observed in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNA isoforms. Importantly, microRNAs target distinct cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNAs. Hence this work, integrating deep-sequencing, subcellular fractionation and microRNA profiling, demonstrates the disruption of post-transcriptional regulatory processes as the main disease causing molecular mechanism in asthma, something that cannot be dissected employing more classic transcriptomics approaches alone.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85215	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)	4.718	https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701798	{Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950) (4.718): 10.4049/jimmunol.1701798}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA336574	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA336574	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP080955	[Overal design]We performed cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound RNA-seq of bronchial epithelial cells from healthy controls and severe asthmatic patients.

GSE104028	Arabidopsis thaliana	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL17639	Analysis of the translational landscape of Arabidopsis mitochondria	2017-09-19	Messenger RNA translation is a complex process that is still poorly understood in eukaryotic organelles like mitochondria. Growing evidence indicate though that mitochondrial translation differs from its bacterial counterpart in many key aspects. In this analysis, we used the ribosome profiling technology to generate a genome-wide snapshot view of mitochondrial translation in Arabidopsis. We show that, unlike in humans, most Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosomes footprints measure 27 and 28 bases. We also reveal that respiratory subunits encoding mRNAs show much higher ribosome association than other mitochondrial mRNAs, implying that they are translated to higher levels. Homogenous ribosome densities were generally detected within each respiratory complex except for complex V where higher ribosome coverage corroborate with higher needs in specific subunits. In complex I respiratory mutants, a slight reorganization of mitochondrial mRNAs ribosome association was detected involving an increase in ribosome densities on certain ribosomal protein encoding transcripts and a reduction in the translation of a few complex V mRNAs. Altogether, our observations reveal that plant mitochondrial translation is a dynamic process and that translational control is important for gene expression in plant mitochondria. This study paves the way for future advances in the understanding of translation in higher plant mitochondria.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104028	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky489	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gky489}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA407986	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA407986	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP118154	[Overal design]In this study, 2 Arabidopsis mutants are compared to the wild type using duplicates for the Ribosome Profiling experiment.

It regulates multiple steps throughout the RNA life cycle including RNA processing, translation, and metabolism, via the recognition by selective binding proteins. In cytoplasm, m6A binding protein YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m6A-modified mRNAs, and YTHDF2 accelerates the decay of m6A-modified transcripts. The biological function of YTHDF3, another cytoplasmic m6A binder of the YTH domain family, remains unknown. Here, we report that YTHDF3 promotes protein synthesis in synergy with YTHDF1, and affects methylated mRNA decay mediated by YTHDF2. Cells deficient in all of YTHDF proteins experience the most dramatic accumulation of the m6A-methylated transcripts. These results indicate that in cytoplasm, YTHDF proteins act in an integrated and cooperative network to accelerate metabolism of m6A-modified mRNAs. The combinative and dynamic nature of YTHDF proteins may collectively impact fundamental biological processes and diseases related to m6A RNA methylation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86214	Cell research	17.848	https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2017.15	{Cell research (17.848): 10.1038/cr.2017.15}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA340948	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA340948	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP083699	[Overal design]We utilized PAR-CLIP triplicates and RIP replicates to identify binding sites and target transcripts of YTHDF3, and performed ribosome profling replicates to assess the consequences of YTHDF3 siRNA knock-down in HeLa cells.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Human HeLa cell line used in this study was purchased from ATCC (CCL-2) and grown in DMEM (Gibco, 11995) media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% 100 × Pen/Strep (Gibco).'; [Extraction]'Fed with 200 uM 4SU, 365 nm UV crosslinked, partial digested with Rnase T1, anti-Flag beads IP, SDS-PAGE gel size selection\nNEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina®', 'Anti-Flag beads IP\nIllumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit', 'Extracted with Trizol, and poly-dT beads selection\nIllumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit', 'Extracted with Trizol, and rRNA removal with ribominus kit\nIllumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit', 'Isolated according to illumina Truseq Ribo Profile kit: Nuclease digestion, Microspin S-400 column separation, RNA extration, TBE gel size selection\nNEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina®', 'Isolated according to illumina Truseq Ribo Profile kit: total RNA (>200 nt) extraction, rRNA removal, and fragmentation\nNEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina®', 'Anti-Flag beads IP, and then rRNA removal with ribominus kit\nIllumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: HeLa cells; cell treatment: N terminal Flag-HA tagged YTHDF3 HeLa stable expression cell line; ', 'cell line: HeLa cells; cell treatment: overexpress N terminal Flag tagged YTHDF3 for 24 hr (0.75 ug plasmid/ml media); ', 'cell line: HeLa cells; cell treatment: 40 nM siRNA knockdown for 48 hr, then 100 ug/ml Cycloheximide (CHX) incubation; ', 'cell line: HeLa cells; cell treatment: 40 nM siRNA knockdown for 48 hr in Flag-HA-YTHDF1 stable expression HeLa cell line; ', 'cell line: HeLa cells; cell treatment: 40 nM siRNA knockdown for 48 hr in Flag-HA-YTHDF2 stable expression HeLa cell line; '

The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, as viral polymerases cleave 5′m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (‘cap-snatching’). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could drive the expression of chimeric human-viral coding sequences. Here, we report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination (‘start-snatching’), which creates, depending on the translatability of the viral UTRs, human-virus protein chimeras either as N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, can generate T cell responses and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that IAV, and likely a multitude of other human-, animal- and plant-viruses, use this host-dependent mechanism to expand their proteome diversity during infection.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148245	Cell	36.216	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.035	{Cell (36.216): 10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.035}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA623585	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA623585	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP255621	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of influenza A infected cells; [Treatment]'Cells were infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) at an MOI of 3'; [Growth]'A549 human lung epithelial cells  were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, and maintained at 37C and 5% CO2'; [Extraction]'RNaseI footprinting, pelleting of ribosomes, RNA-extraction with TRIzol reagent, linker ligation onto footprints, reverse-transcription,cDNA circularization, rRNA depletion, PCR amplification'; [Cell type]'Source: ''innoculum: A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1); treatment: harringtonine; ', 'innoculum: A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1); treatment: dmso; '

GSE64962	Homo sapiens	42	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Improved transcription and translation with L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1	2015-01-14	Roberts syndrome (RBS) is a human developmental disorder caused by mutations in the cohesin acetyltransferase ESCO2. We previously reported that mTORC1 was inhibited and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells. Treatment of RBS cells with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division. In this study, we use RBS as a model for mTOR inhibition and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine genome-wide effects of L-leucine. The translational efficiency of many genes is increased with Lleucine in RBS cells including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function. snoRNAs are strongly upregulated in RBS cells, but decreased with L-leucine. Imprinted genes, including H19 and GTL2, are differentially expressed in RBS cells consistent with contribution to mTORC1 control. This study reveals dramatic effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 and supports that ESCO2 function is required for normal gene expression and translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64962	BMC genomics	3.501	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-015-2354-y	{BMC genomics (3.501): 10.1186/s12864-015-2354-y}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA272597	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA272597	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP052229	[Overal design]42 samples of human fibroblast cell lines with various genotypes (wt, corrected, and esco2 mutants) are treated with l-leucine or d-leucine (control) for 3 or 24 hours.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71900	Molecular cancer therapeutics	4.856	https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414	{Molecular cancer therapeutics (4.856): 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292420	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292420	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP062230	[Overal design]Profiles of MCF7 and HCT116 Akti-1/2 treated cells and MCF7 and HCT116 vehicle (i.e. DMSO) treated cells were generated, each in duplicate, using RNA-Seq.; [Treatment]'Cells were treated for 72h with vehicle (DMSO), Akti-1/2 inhibitor (HCT116: 20µM; MCF7: 2µM) (Sigma)'; [Growth]'MCF7 was maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 40mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin; HCT116 was maintained in McCoy’s 5α medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin.

However, how this is molecularly achieved remains largely unresolved. Here, we develop an in vivo mouse model of liver cancer to study oncogene cooperation in immunosurveillance. We show that MYC overexpression (MYCTg) synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone. Genome-wide ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg;KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs, including programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis revealed that PD-L1 translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional, non-canonical upstream open reading frames in its 5′ untranslated region, which is bypassed in MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack. We show that this mechanism of PD-L1 translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent, clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation, eFT508, which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors. Together, these studies reveal how immune-checkpoint proteins are manipulated by distinct oncogenes at the level of mRNA translation, which can be exploited for new immunotherapies.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE105147	Nature medicine	30.641	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0321-2	{Nature medicine (30.641): 10.1038/s41591-018-0321-2}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA414959	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA414959	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP120478	[Overal design]To identify the transcripts specifically translated in primary liver tumors in MYC; KRAS(G12D) and KRAS(G12D) mice, we first carefully micro-dissected primary liver tumor nodules in MYC; KRAS(G12D) and KRAS(G12D) mice as well as wildtype (WT) controls.

It is an established notion that translational control takes place essentially at the translation initiation level, therefore the variation in abundance of a given mRNA species on polysomes can be directly related to the variation in abundance of the corresponding protein. Comparison of translatome profile changes with corresponding transcriptome profile changes can provide a measure of the degree of concordance between cellular controls affecting mRNA abundance and cellular controls affecting mRNA availability to translation. To provide a direct experimental evaluation of the phenomenon, we decided to study a classical example of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) treatment. This stimulus triggers a well known chain of intracellular transduction events, ultimately resulting in a multifaceted phenotypic spectrum of changes with prevalent induction of cell growth and proliferation. We subjected HeLa cells to serum starvation for 12h and then we added EGF at final concentration of 1 μg/ml, profiling before and after 40 minutes of treatment the transcriptome, the translatome, coming from the polysomal pool of mRNAs after sucrose gradient separation, and also the mRNA content of the subpolysomal pool, expected not to be actively translated.

Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59095	Scientific reports	4.011	https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25996	{Scientific reports (4.011): 10.1038/srep25996}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA254361	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA254361	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP044064	[Overal design]Examination of translation at whole genome scale under conditions of overexpression of WT DDX3X or cancer-associated DDX3X mutant G325E; [Treatment]'HEK293T cells were transfected with either empty vector or FLAG-tagged DDX3X constructs for 24 h.

We use RNA-seq and ribosome profiling to systematically look at host genes RNA and translation levels along IAV infection. We show that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels and that the high translation levels of IAV transcripts are driven by their strong accumulation compared to host transcripts. Interestingly, our systematic analysis reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and the extent of cellular mRNAs reduction is strongly related to transcripts’ length and GC content.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82232	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18311	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.18311}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA324409	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA324409	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP076102	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq along IAV infection; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation, treated with RNase I for 45min and then loaded on a sucrose cushion.

Deep RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling were employed to systematically analyze messenger RNA and ribosome-protected RNA in EV71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma cells at progressive time points following infection. The analysis characterized the dynamic transcriptional and translational landscapes of both the virus and host cells. The results indicated that reduced translation of cellular mRNAs played a key role in EV71-induced host shutoff rather than mRNA depletion. During the host shutoff, EV71 protein was preferably synthesized through both a translational advantage and abundant mRNA production. Moreover, a small number of cellular genes were resistant to the host shutoff through both transcriptional and translational regulation, including genes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that is important for EV71 replication. These results indicated selective cellular protein synthesis during EV71-induced host shutoff as a mechanism the virus utilizes to benefit its replication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103308	Protein & cell	7.575	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-018-0535-6	{Protein & cell (7.575): 10.1007/s13238-018-0535-6}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA401882	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA401882	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP131318	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq of RD cell infected with EV71 or mock, 3 time points, two triplicate in the last two time points, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.; [Treatment]'100 μg/mL cycloheximaide for 9 minutes'; [Growth]'High glucose DMEM with 10% FBS and 4mM L-Gln'; [Extraction]'Cell were harvest and RNA was extracted as TruSeq Ribo Profile (Mammalian) Kit (Illumina) manual.\nRNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using TruSeq Ribo Profile (Mammalian) Kit (Illumina)'; [Cell type]'RD''cell type: RD; infection: mock; virus strain: not applicable; time: 1.75 h; ', 'cell type: RD; infection: Enterovirus 71; virus strain: SK-EV006/Malaysia/97; time: 1.75 h; ', 'cell type: RD; infection: mock; virus strain: not applicable; time: 3.5 h; ', 'cell type: RD; infection: Enterovirus 71; virus strain: SK-EV006/Malaysia/97; time: 3.5 h; ', 'cell type: RD; infection: mock; virus strain: not applicable; time: 6.25 h; ', 'cell type: RD; infection: Enterovirus 71; virus strain: SK-EV006/Malaysia/97; time: 6.25 h; '

Like other herpesviruses, our understanding of their protein coding potential is far from complete. Here we use ribosome profiling and RNA-seq to experimentally define the HHV-6 translation products and to follow their temporal expression. We identified hundreds of new open reading frames (ORF)s, including many upstream ORFs (uORF)s and internal ORFs (iORF)s, generating a complete atlas of HHV-6 translation products. Integrating data from human cytomegalovirus we uncover numerous uORFs and iORFs that are conserved between beta herpesviruses and we show uORFs are specifically enriched in late viral genes. We also identified three highly abundant viral long non coding RNAs (lncRNA)s and we show one of these lncRNAs generate a non-polyadenylated stable intron that is conserved between all sequenced beta herpesviruses. Overall, this work uncovers the full complexity of the HHV-6 family genomes and highlights novel features that are conserved between beta herpesviruses, providing a resource for future functional studies.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135363	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50960	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.50960}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA558563	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA558563	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP217339	[Overal design]Ribosme profiling and RNA-seq along HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'cells were treated with 100µg/mL cycloheximide for 1 minute.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71895	Molecular cancer therapeutics	4.856	https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414	{Molecular cancer therapeutics (4.856): 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292422	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292422	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP062228	[Overal design]Microvesicle content profiles of MCF7 and HCT116 Akti-1/2 treated cells and MCF7 and HCT116 vehicle (i.e. DMSO) treated cells were generated, using technical replicates, using small RNA-Seq.; [Treatment]'Cells were treated for 72h with vehicle (DMSO), Akti-1/2 inhibitor (HCT116: 20µM; MCF7: 2µM) (Sigma)'; [Growth]'MCF7 was maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 40mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin; HCT116 was maintained in McCoy’s 5α medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin.

Therefore, cells tightly control mRNA translation rates in response to external stimuli (growth factors, differentiation signals) and the internal resources available (nutrients, energy). We set out to unravel new molecular mechanisms of global translation control required for cellular homeostasis. Using a siRNA screening approach to knock-down all human kinases and phosphatases, we analyzed the impact of protein phosphorylation on translation regulation in unstressed, proliferating cells. A visual screen was conducted to assess stress granule formation (as a consequence of translational shutdown) in the absence of 711 kinases and 256 phosphatases. Several candidates identified in the screen are linked, either directly or indirectly, to cell cycle regulation. We further identified a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), whose genetic downregulation or chemical inhibition results in global translation suppression. In order to assess CDK downstream signaling, we performed phosphoproteomics analysis and found the phosphorylation status of many ribosomal proteins to be altered upon CDK inhibition. Indeed, we could show that S6-kinase 1 partially contributes to CDK-dependent translational control. Ribosome profiling further revealed that the translation of 5’TOP mRNAs, including many mRNAs encoding for ribosomal proteins, is especially sensitive to CDK inhibition. While the translation regulatory function of this kinase is independent of the cell cycle phase, its activity is ideally suited to couple the overall proliferation rate of cells to the global rate of protein synthesis. Our results identify a pathway that enables cells to directly adapt protein homeostasis to proliferation and growth signals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE128538	The Journal of cell biology	8.891	https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201906147	{The Journal of cell biology (8.891): 10.1083/jcb.201906147}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA528026	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA528026	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP188848	[Overal design]RO-3306 or DMSO treated RPEI cells were subjected to ribosome profiling in three biological replicates.

GSE100026	Homo sapiens	15	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	Transcriptome characterization of chronic myeloid leukemia by RNA sequencing	2017-06-14	To determine differentially expressed and spliced transcripts in chronic myeloid leukemia, a high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of ten CML specimens and five normal peripheral blood samples was performed. Thousands of differentially expressed genes between CML and normal control were detected, including genes involved in ribosome and signaling pathway. Splicing alterations analysis performed by an independently developed algorithm reveals that intron retention was the most frequent alternative splicing (AS) events in all the samples. Functional groups of differentially spliced genes most highly correlated with disease phase was (blast crisis relative to chronic phase) included spliceosome and nucleotide excision repair (NER), suggesting that genes involved in these processes may have a major contribution to CML progression by affecting splicing factors and DNA damage and repair as a consequence of mis-splicing.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100026	Journal of advanced research	5.045	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jare.2020.04.016	{Journal of advanced research (5.045): 10.1016/j.jare.2020.04.016}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA390519	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA390519	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP109177	[Overal design]mRNA profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five patients in chronic phase(CP), five in blast crisis(BC) of chronic myeloid leukemia and five healthy volunteers were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina NextSeq 500.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Peripheral blood  mononuclear cells were harvested, flash frozen on dry ice, and RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent.

We found that circMYBL2 knockdown specifically inhibits proliferation and promotes the differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells in vitro and in vivo. We used the ribosome profiling and RNA-seq libraries sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 to identify the mRNA that circMYBL2 targeted. Interestingly, we found that circMYBL2 significantly influences the protein level of mutant FLT3 kinase, which contributes to the activation of FLT3-ITD-dependent signaling pathways. Mechanistically, circMYBL2 enhanced the translational efficiency of FLT3 kinase by increasing the binding of PTBP1 to FLT3 mRNA. Moreover, circMYBL2 knockdown impaired the cytoactivity of inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive cells, with a significant decrease in FLT3 kinase expression, followed by the inactivation of its downstream pathways. In summary, we are the first to reveal a circRNA that specifically influences FLT3-ITD AML and regulates FLT3 kinase levels through translational regulation, suggesting that circMYBL2 may be a potential therapeutic target for FLT3-ITD AML.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133925	Blood	16.562	https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019000802	{Blood (16.562): 10.1182/blood.2019000802}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA553142	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA553142	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP213599	[Overal design]Sh-NC and sh-circMYBL2 MOLM-13 cells used; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'QIAseq® FastSelectTM RNA Removal Kit\nPrecision small RNA library prep for Illumina® NGS systems'; [Cell type]'acute myeloid leukemia cells''cell line: MOLM-13; cell type: acute myeloid leukemia cells; '

High-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) has been widely adopted to investigate the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs. However, accurate quantification of miRNAs has been limited owing to the severe ligation bias in conventional sRNA-seq methods. Here we quantify miRNAs and their variants (known as isomiRs) by an improved sRNA-seq protocol, termed AQ-seq (accurate quantification by sequencing), that utilizes adapters with terminal degenerate sequences and a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which minimize the ligation bias during library preparation. Measurement using AQ-seq allows us to correct the previously misannotated 5′ end usage and strand preference in public databases. Importantly, the analysis of 5′ terminal heterogeneity reveals widespread alternative processing events which have been underestimated. We also identify highly uridylated miRNAs originating from the 3p strands, indicating regulations mediated by terminal uridylyl transferases at the pre-miRNA stage. Taken together, our study reveals the complexity of the miRNA isoform landscape, allowing us to refine miRNA annotation and to advance our understanding of miRNA regulation. Furthermore, AQ-seq can be adopted to improve other ligation-based sequencing methods including crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123627	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1293	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gky1293}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA509424	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA509424	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP173274	"[Overal design]Total RNA was isolated from HEK293T and HeLa cells, mixed with thirty synthetic miRNA-like spike-in oligos, and subjected to small RNA-seq library preparation using TruSeq (Illumina) or the AQ-seq method.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM media (Welgene) supplemented with 10% FBS (Welgene).'; [Extraction]""Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen).\nTotal RNA was mixed with thirty synthetic miRNA-like spike-in oligos.

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacylated tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels with specific isoacceptor patterns and a correlation with codon usage. tRNAs for isoleucine, asparagine, aspartate and arginine were lowly loaded and conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex relation between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126383	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	9.58	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1918145117	{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (9.580): 10.1073/pnas.1918145117}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA521742	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA521742	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP185485	"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of liver harvested from mice fed Ad libitum or fasted; [Treatment]'Immediately after the organ collection, livers were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 20 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX conditions) or no cycloheximide (NOCHX conditions), 10 U/µl RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs), and a protease inhibitor cocktail containing 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml Aprotinin, 0.7 µg/ml Pepstatin A, and 0.7 µg/ml Leupeptin.'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]""Ribosome unprotected-mRNAs were digested with RNAse I (350 U/mg of protein, Invitrogen) and resulting footprints were isolated (sucrose gradients, monosome peaks) and extracted with classical methods using guanidium  thiocyanate lysis buffer.\nEluted RNA was heat denatured 3 min at 65°C.

Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within D. melanogaster and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49197	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01179	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.01179}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA213294	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA213294	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP028243	[Overal design]12 samples of Drosophila ribosome profiling and poly(A)+ mRNA-seq, including technical replicates in S2 cells, and biological replicates of 0-2 hour embryos; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Samples were lysed using the indicated strategies in the indicated buffers.

GSE144140	Homo sapiens	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL24676	Use of NanoLuc-Based Reporters that Monitor Nonsense Suppression and Inhibition of Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay to Identify Potent New Agents That Partially Reverse the Effects of Nonsense Mutations	2020-01-23	Premature termination codons (PTCs) lead to loss of protein function by 1) ending mRNA translation before a full-length protein is made, and 2) by triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a pathway that targets a PTC-containing mRNA for degradation. Nonsense suppression therapy aims to restore protein function by suppressing termination at PTCs (called readthrough, or RT). However, the efficiency of current readthrough agents is generally quite low. We reasoned that by stimulating both readthrough and increasing mRNA levels, greater protein function can be restored than with readthrough alone. In this study, we developed a series of novel NanoLuc reporters designed to identify and differentiate compounds that induce readthrough, enhance mRNA abundance (by NMD inhibition or other mechanisms), or target both mechanisms simultaneously (referred to as dual RT/NMD reporters). We show that treatments that promote readthrough and NMD inhibition led to synergistic increases in NanoLuc activity of the RT/NMD reporter over either condition alone. We then used a dual RT/NMD reporter to carry out a high throughput screen of a library of 771,345 compounds. We identified 180 compounds with the ability to increase NanoLuc activity in our dual RT/NMD reporter assay. To confirm that such synergy can also amplify protein function in a disease model, we treated cells expressing a CFTR-Y122X mini-intron construct with one hit from this screen, SRI-37240. We found that this compound produced a much larger increase in CFTR activity compared to either the RT compound G418 +/- the NMD inhibitor amlexanox, and the activity obtained could be further enhanced with CFTR modulators. These results confirm the utility of these new reporters to identify many potent new molecules that counteract the effects of nonsense mutations.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144140	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA602876	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA602876	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP244347	[Overal design]9 ribosome profiling samples are included from HEK293T cells; [Treatment]'Drugs were added to cells and treated for 24 hours'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS to ~75% confluency before harvest'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed on ice in the presence of cycloheximide.

GSE94827	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Inhibiting the oncogenic translation program is an effective therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma	2017-02-13	Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a frequently incurable hematological cancer in which over activity of MYC plays a central role, notably through upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translation. To better understand the oncogenic program driven by MYC and investigate its potential as a therapeutic target, we screened a chemically diverse small molecule library for anti-MM activity. The most potent hits identified were rocaglate-scaffold inhibitors of translation initiation. Expression profiling of MM cells revealed reversion of the oncogenic MYC-driven transcriptional program by CMLD010509, our most promising rocaglate. Proteome-wide, reversion correlated with selective depletion of short-lived proteins key to MM growth and survival, most notably MYC, MDM2, CCND1, MAF and MCL-1. The efficacy of CMLD010509 in mouse models of MM confirmed the therapeutic relevance of these findings in vivo and supports the feasibility of targeting the oncogenic MYC-driven translation program in MM with rocaglates.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94827	Science translational medicine	17.161	https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aal2668	{Science translational medicine (17.161): 10.1126/scitranslmed.aal2668}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA374537	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA374537	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP099436	[Overal design]RNA sequencing of 5 cell lines (NCI-H929, NAMALWA, U266, MM1S and OPM2) treated with CMLD010509 or vehicle control (DMSO); [Treatment]'Cells were treated by either CMLD010509-treated 50nM 6 hours or vehicle control (DMSO)'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in RPMI 10% FBS'; [Extraction]'Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN).\nNEBNext RNA library prep kit'; [Cell type]'Multiple Myeloma cell line', 'Burkitt Lymphoma cell line''cell line: NCI-H929; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: DMSO-treated; ', 'cell line: NCI-H929; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: CMLD010509-treated 50nM 6 hours; ', 'cell line: NAMALWA; cell type: Burkitt Lymphoma cell line; condition: DMSO-treated; ', 'cell line: NAMALWA; cell type: Burkitt Lymphoma cell line; condition: CMLD010509-treated 50nM 6 hours; ', 'cell line: MM1S; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: DMSO-treated; ', 'cell line: MM1S; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: CMLD010509-treated 50nM 6 hours; ', 'cell line: OPM2; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: DMSO-treated; ', 'cell line: OPM2; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: CMLD010509-treated 50nM 6 hours; ', 'cell line: U266; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: DMSO-treated; ', 'cell line: U266; cell type: Multiple Myeloma cell line; condition: CMLD010509-treated 50nM 6 hours; '

NMD is a RNA quality control mechanism, which detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs as well as some normal transcripts including those that harbor upstream open reading frames in their 5' leader sequence and long 3′ UTR. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3 or Upf1 depletion in human cells. Our bioinformatics analyses allow to delineate the features of the transcripts controlled by eRF3 and Upf1 and to compare the effect of each of these factors on gene expression. We show that eRF3 and Upf1 have very different impact on the human transcriptome, only ~250 transcripts being targeted by both factors. We also show that in contrast to Upf1, eRF3a depletion globally derepressed the expression of mRNAs containing translated uORFs. Finally, we find that eRF3a and Upf1 have opposite effects on ribosome protein gene expression. Together, our results provide important elements for understanding the impact of translation termination and NMD on the human transcriptome and reveal novel determinants of ribosome biogenesis regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126385	RNA biology	5.477	https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2019.1674595	{RNA biology (5.477): 10.1080/15476286.2019.1674595}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA521751	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA521751	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP185496	[Overal design]Examination of the translational consequences of the inactivation of the eRF3 and Upf1 in HCT-116; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Maintained in McCoy medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere'; [Extraction]'Ribosome Profiling was performed as described in Baudin-Baillieu et al, 2016 and total RNA was purified by hot acid phenol extraction\ncDNA library from 100 ng RNA was prepared by the Imagif plateform (Institut de Biologie Intégrative de la Cellule, Gif sur Yvette, France), using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit with 3’ sRNA Adapter (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Here we combine SLAM-seq, a novel method for direct quantification of newly synthesized mRNAs, with pharmacological and rapid chemical-genetic perturbation to interrogate primary transcriptional targets of BRD4 and MYC and define the response to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). While BRD4 acts as a global co-activator of Pol2-dependent transcription in a BET bromodomain-dependent manner, therapeutic BETi doses deregulate a small set of hypersensitive target genes. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator that controls basic metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de-novo purine synthesis across diverse cancer contexts. Beyond defining primary regulatory functions of BRD4 and MYC in cancer, our study establishes a simple, robust and scalable approach to dissect direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111460	None	None	None	None	'genomic DNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA437112	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA437112	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP134016	[Overal design]Baseline gene expression profiling of clonal cell lines engineered to express AID-tagged proteins and unedited controls by 3'mRNA sequencing.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (10’, RT).

Human eEF1A is post-translationally methylated on several lysine residues as well as on the N-terminus and until recently the responsible methyltransferases were largely elusive. Using mass spectrometry based screens, gene targeted cells and in vitro enzymology we identify the human methyltransferase like proteins 13 (METTL13), which contains two distinct methyltransferase domains, as an enzyme catalyzing both dimethylation of Lys55 and trimethylation of the N-terminus of eEF1A. Moreover, through ribosome profiling we demonstrate that loss of METTL13 function alters translation dynamics and results in changed translation rate of specific codons. In line with the established descriptive nomenclature for this type of enzymes we suggest that METTL13 is redubbed eEF1A dual methyltransferase (eEF1A-DMT / EEF1ADMT).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104033	Nature communications	11.878	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05646-y	{Nature communications (11.878): 10.1038/s41467-018-05646-y}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA408071	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA408071	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP118278	[Overal design]ribosome profiling and poly(A) RNA sequencing of wildtype and MELL13-KO cells.

Since cancer initiation is complex we used a multi-omic approach to identify gene expression patterns that distinguish COPD stroma in patients with or without lung cancer. We obtained lung tissue from patients with COPD and lung cancer (tumor and adjacent non-malignant tissue) and those with COPD without lung cancer for proteomic and mRNA (cytoplasmic and polyribosomal) profiling. We used the joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) method to integrate and analysis across the three datasets. JIVE identified eight latent patterns that robustly distinguished and separated the three groups of tissue samples. Predictive variables that associated with the tumor, compared to adjacent stroma, were mainly represented in the transcriptomic data, whereas, predictive variables associated with adjacent tissue compared to controls was represented at the translatomic level. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed extracellular matrix (ECM) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways as important signals in the pre-malignant stroma. COPD stroma adjacent to lung cancer is unique and differs from non-malignant COPD tissue and is distinguished by the extracellular matrix and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106899	The European respiratory journal	11.807	https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02665-2017	{The European respiratory journal (11.807): 10.1183/13993003.02665-2017}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA418402	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA418402	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP125001	[Overal design]Polysome-profiling of lung tumor, adjacent non-cancerous lung stroma tissue samples from the same patient compared to patients without lung cancer across a range of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Frozen lung tissue samples ranging in weight from 25-60 mg were individually ground to a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen cooled ceramic mortar and pestle.

The polyribosomal mRNA from fractions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were individually processed with 1 mL of TRI Reagent and 200 µL chloroform and the resultant RNA pellets from these four fractions were combined to create the polyribosomal mRNA sample corresponding to each tissue sample. Polyribosomal mRNA and cytosolic RNA were sent to the University of Minnesota Genomics Core for quality assessment by Caliper High Sensitivity Lab Chip. Those samples passing the Caliper QC were processed into indexed library samples for analysis by RNA sequencing.

Here we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including ERVs, and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to dsRNA stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors, and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy. Consistently, TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between LSD1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration in various human cancers. Our study identifies LSD1 as a potent inhibitor of anti-tumor immunity and responsiveness to immunotherapy, and suggests LSD1 inhibition combined with PD-(L)1 blockade as a novel cancer treatment strategy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112230	Cell	36.216	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.052	{Cell (36.216): 10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.052}	'genomic DNA', 'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA445303	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA445303	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP136272	"[Overal design]Gene expression profiling of in vitro control and LSD1 KD MCF-7 cells (in biological replicates), as well as ex vivo scramble, LSD1 KO and LSD1/MDA5 DKO B16 tumor cells (in biological triplicates) was analyzed by RNA-seq.

Here we combine SLAM-seq, a novel method for direct quantification of newly synthesized mRNAs, with pharmacological and rapid chemical-genetic perturbation to interrogate primary transcriptional targets of BRD4 and MYC and define the response to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). While BRD4 acts as a global co-activator of Pol2-dependent transcription in a BET bromodomain-dependent manner, therapeutic BETi doses deregulate a small set of hypersensitive target genes. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator that controls basic metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de-novo purine synthesis across diverse cancer contexts. Beyond defining primary regulatory functions of BRD4 and MYC in cancer, our study establishes a simple, robust and scalable approach to dissect direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111457	None	None	None	None	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA437106	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA437106	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP134014	"[Overal design]Baseline gene expression profiling of clonal cell lines engineered to express AID-tagged proteins and unedited controls by 3'mRNA sequencing.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]""Total RNA was extracted using a commercial column purification kit.\n3'UTR sequencing libraries were generated from 500ng total RNA using a commercial kit (QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina, Lexogen).""; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: K562; ', 'cell line: K562; genetic modification: AID-BRD4; ', 'cell line: K562; genetic modification: MYC-AID; '"

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138638	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576649	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576649	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224952	[Overal design]18 ribosome profiling and 8 paired-end RNA-seq samples are included from HEK293T cells; [Treatment]'Aminoglycosides were added to cells, and treated for either 10 minutes or 24 hours'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS to ~75% confluency before harvest'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed on ice in the presence of cycloheximide.

The human fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) responds to environmental or host temperature by initiating unique transcriptional programs to specify multicellular (hyphae) or unicellular (yeast) developmental states that function in infectivity or pathogenesis, respectively. Here we used recent advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation in Hc developmental cell types. We found that ~2% percent of Hc transcripts exhibit 5’ leader sequences that differ markedly in length between morphogenetic states. Ribosome density and mRNA abundance measurements uncovered a class of differential leader transcripts that exhibit tight transcriptional and translational regulation. Further examination of these dually regulated genes revealed that some control Hc morphology and that their strict regulation is necessary for the pathogen to make appropriate developmental decisions in response to temperature.

The anticodon modification mcm5s2U34 is required for normal growth and stress resistance in yeast; mutants lacking this modification have numerous phenotypes. Mutations in the homologous human genes are linked to neurological disease. The yeast phenotypes can be ameliorated by overexpression of specific tRNAs, suggesting that the modifications are necessary for efficient translation of specific codons. We determined the in vivo ribosome distributions at single codon resolution in yeast strains lacking mcm5s2U. We found accumulations at AAA, CAA, and GAA codons, suggesting that translation is slow when these codons are in the ribosomal A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein output. Instead, we observed activation of the GCN4-mediated stress response by a non- canonical pathway. Thus, loss of mcm5s2U causes global effects on gene expression due to perturbation of cellular signaling.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45366	PLoS genetics	5.224	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003675	{PLoS genetics (5.224): 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003675}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA193543	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA193543	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP019833	"[Overal design]WT yeast and mutants lacking anticodon tRNA modifications were grown in YPD, and subjected to ribosome footprint profiling (ribo-seq) and RNA-seq of poly-A selected RNA.

GSE119681	Mus musculus	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13112	Ribosome profiling of selenoproteins in vivo reveals consequences of pathogenic Secisbp2 missense mutations	2018-09-07	Re-coding of UGA codons as selenocysteine (Sec) codons in selenoproteins depends on a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3’ UTR of mRNAs of eukaryotic selenoproteins. SECIS-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of this process. Pathogenic mutations in SECISBP2 reduce selenoprotein expression and lead to phenotypes associated with the reduction of deiodinase activities and selenoprotein N expression in humans. Two functions have been ascribed to SECISBP2: binding of SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs and facilitation of co-translational Sec insertion. To separately probe both functions, we established here two mouse models carrying two pathogenic missense mutations in Secisbp2 previously identified in patients. We found that the C696R substitution in the RNAbinding domain abrogates SECIS binding and does not support selenoprotein translation above the level of a complete Secisbp2 null mutation. The R543Q missense substitution located in the selenocysteine insertion domain resulted in residual activity and caused reduced selenoprotein translation, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling to determine the impact on UGA re-coding in individual selenoproteins. We found, however, that the R543Q variant is thermally unstable in vitro and completely degraded in the mouse liver in vivo, while being partially functional in the brain. The moderate impairment of selenoprotein expression in neurons led to astrogliosis and transcriptional induction of genes associated with immune responses. We conclude that differential SECISBP2 protein stability in individual cell types may dictate clinical phenotypes to a much greater extent than molecular interactions involving a mutated amino acid in SECISBP2 .	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119681	The Journal of biological chemistry	4.106	https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA119.009369	{The Journal of biological chemistry (4.106): 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009369}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA489895	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA489895	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP160398	"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing of cortex samples from 2 Secisbp2 R543Q/fl; Camk-Cre pos mice and 2 control mice.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]""Tissue powder was lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mg/ml cycloheximide, 100 mM DTT and 1% Triton X-100), ribosome pellets were resuspended in Qiazol (Qiagen) after centrifugation of RNaseI digested monosomes in 50% sucrose buffer, ribosome protected fragments were isolated using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer protocol with modification to retain small RNAs.\nRPFs were electrophoresed on a 15% Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) Urea gel and RNA fragments between 20 and 40 nts in size were purified prior to the construction of libraries for deep-sequencing.

GSE61742	Homo sapiens	72	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein	2014-09-25	Genetic variants that impact gene regulation are important contributors to human phenotypic variation. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made to identify genetic associations with differences in mRNA levels of nearby genes, namely, cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The phenotypic consequences of eQTLs are presumably due, in most cases, to their ultimate effects on protein expression levels. Yet, only few studies have quantified the impact of genetic variation on proteins levels directly. It remains unclear how faithfully eQTLs are reflected at the protein level, and whether there is a significant layer of cis regulatory variation acting primarily on translation or steady state protein levels. To address these questions, we measured ribosome occupancy by high-throughput sequencing, and relative protein levels by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in which we had previously measured transcript expression using RNA sequencing. We then mapped genetic variants that are associated with changes in transcript expression (eQTLs), ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). Most of the QTLs we detected are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, we found that eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a class of cis QTLs that specifically affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA levels; most of these QTLs have little effect on ribosome occupancy, and hence may arise from differences in post-translational regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61742	Science (New York, N.Y.)	41.037	https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1260793	{Science (New York, N.Y.)

GSE124800	Homo sapiens	6	Expression profiling by array	GPL24299	Rules governing translation selectivity under limiting ribosome availability	2019-01-08	Ribosomopathies are cell-type-specific pathologies related to a ribosomal protein (RP) gene insult. The 5q- syndrome is a somatic ribosomopathy linked to RPS14 gene haploinsufficiency and characterized by a prominent erythroid hypoplasia. Using quantitative proteomic, we show that GATA1 protein expression is low in shRPS14 cells in which ribosome quantities are diminished. Here, we investigated the cause of low GATA1 protein expression in limiting ribosome availability. A global analysis of translation in RPs deficiencies highlights the rules that drive translation selectivity. We demonstrate that in addition of the transcript length, a high codon adaptation index (CAI) and a highly structured 3’UTR are the key characteristics for a selective translation. An integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome confirms that the post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression are directly linked to the criteria governing the translational selectivity. In particular, these criteria explain GATA1 translation default with unprecedented precision. More generally, the proteins that accumulate along normal erythropoiesis share the determinants of translation selectivity revealed by the conditions of limiting ribosome availability.

GSE56924	Homo sapiens	96	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	Ribosome profiling reveals an important role for translational control in circadian gene expression	2014-04-18	Physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms are driven by a conserved transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop in mammals. Although most core clock factors are transcription factors, post-transcriptional control introduces delays that are critical for circadian oscillations. Little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock. We found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mRNAs does not arise from regulated translation. Nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mRNAs and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on non-cycling mRNAs. Most cyclically transcribed RNAs are translated at one of two major times in a 24h day, while rhythmic translation of most non-cyclic RNAs is phased to a single time of day. Unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56924	Genome research	9.944	https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.191296.115	{Genome research (9.944): 10.1101/gr.191296.115}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA244941	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA244941	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP041298	[Overal design]U2-OS cell time course over one day of 12 wildtype total RNA-seq samples, 12 wildtype ribosome profiling samples, 12 Bmal1 knockdown total RNA-seq samples and 12 Bmal1 knockdown ribosome profiling samples.

GSE65778	Homo sapiens	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	The Small Molecule ISRIB Reverses the Effects of eIF2α Phosphorylation on Translation and Stress Granule Assembly	2015-02-09	We recently identified ISRIB as a potent inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR). ISRIB renders cells resistant to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (10.7554/eLife.00498). Here we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2α and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2α phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2α phosphorylation, SG formation and cognitive loss.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65778	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05033	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.05033}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA274997	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA274997	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP053402	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling with paired RNA-seq; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'maintained at 37o C, 5% CO2 in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin)'; [Extraction]'library construction: IlluminaTruSeqstranded prep\nRNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification', 'library construction: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction\nRNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: HEK293T; treatment: untreated; ', 'cell line: HEK293T; treatment: ISRIB (200 nM) for 1 hour; ', 'cell line: HEK293T; treatment: 1μg/ml of tunicamycin for 1 hour; ', 'cell line: HEK293T; treatment: 1μg/ml of tunicamycin and ISRIB (200 nM) for 1 hour; '

Clinical courses are highly variable, ranging from spontaneous regression/maturation to rapid progression despite intensive multimodal therapy. The estimation of 5-year event free survival in high-risk patients of only about 40 % stresses an importance of novel therapeutic strategies. A number of iron chelators have demonstrated marked in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity and are currently being developed as novel anti-cancer agents. Therefore, the potential antitumor effect of iron chelators in NB cancer was investigated. Among the compounds tested, ciclopirox olamine (CPX) was shown to be one of the most effective intracellular iron chelators in NB cells. To unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CPX on viability of NB cells, microarray analysis was performed in CHP134 control cells and cells treated with 5 µM CPX for 90 minutes. Inclusion of both total RNA (reflecting transcriptional status of the cells) and polysomal RNA (approximating the proteomic representation of the cells) provided us with a deeper understanding of changes in the cells upon CPX treatment.

GSE107169	Homo sapiens	14	Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Circular RNA profiling reveals the different distribution/characteristic and possible transport mechanism among the subcellular fractions	2017-11-20	We systemically investigated the circRNA profiles among the subcellular fractions of HepG2 cell, including nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosome, cytosol and exosome. Our studies reveals the wide distribution of circRNAs among the subcellular fractions except the mitochondria. Further comparative analysis indicate the differential subcellular distributions in expression, length, GC content, classification, alternative circularization and function of the parental genes. Through analyzing the binding motifs distribution of the transport-related RBPs among the subcellular circRNAs, we found that the different subcellular distribution characteristics of circRNAs might be resulted from the RBP-mediated selective transportation. It also implies that the circRNAs may follow the same transportation mechanism as linear RNAs: the RBPs specially recognize, bind to and transport the RNAs with the corresponding binding motifs, regardless of circular or linear RNAs. Our researches not only facilitate better understanding of the life history and molecular behavior of circRNA in cell, but also contribute to the exploration for new biological functions of circRNA.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107169	RNA biology	5.477	https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2019.1565284	{RNA biology (5.477): 10.1080/15476286.2019.1565284}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA419198	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA419198	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP125321	[Overal design]Examined seven fractions of HepG2 (cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, ribsome, cytosol, exosome, mitochodria) and each has two repeats; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Total RNAs from HepG2 cells and its subcellular fractions were extracted using RNAiso Plus reagent (9108, TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and those except for exosomal RNAs were treated with Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (MRZG12324, Illumina) to remove ribosomal RNA before constructing RNA-seq libraries.\nStrand-specific RNA-seq libraries were prepared using Next® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7420, NEB, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results: Fold changes comparing mock and a non-targeting siRNA were highly congruent. Myc RNAi induced numerous changes, with 955 downregulated genes and 1214 upregulated genes. The effect on Myc itself was relatively modest, possibly reflecting its ability to negatively auto-regulate its own expression. Gene ontology analysis highlighted ribosome biogenesis, metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways, consistent with known Myc functions. The Kcnk1 siRNA affected 424 genes, with KCNK1 itself one of the most repressed. While gene ontology analysis also highlighted metabolism and biosynthesis pathways, the p-values and fold enrichment scores were substantially lower, indicating that DiM can be suppressed without major effects on metabolism and biosynthesis pathways. The Snta1 siRNA deregulated 575 genes, with SNTA1 itself the most repressed gene. Cell cycle and mitosis-related gene ontology terms feature heavily, consistent with this siRNA accelerating mitotic exit. Interestingly, FoxM1, which drives G2/M gene expression was reduced 1.75-fold, indicating that this siRNA may disrupt mitotic controls by deregulating FoxM1. Conclusions: Global gene expression profiling identifies Egr1 as regulator of mitotic cell fate.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68219	Cancer cell	23.916	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2015.06.001	{Cancer cell (23.916): 10.1016/j.ccell.2015.06.001}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA282044	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA282044	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP057613	[Overal design]Total RNA was extracted from at least four replicates of siRNA-transfected cells and libraries for sequencing was prepared for each replicate.; [Treatment]'siRNA-transfected or mock-transfected'; [Growth]'Standard culture conditions'; [Extraction]'TRIzol-extracted RNA\nRNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit'; [Cell type]'colon carcinoma cell line''cell line: RKO; cell type: colon carcinoma cell line; tansfected with: non-targeting siRNAs; ', 'cell line: RKO; cell type: colon carcinoma cell line; tansfected with: none (mock-transfected); ', 'cell line: RKO; cell type: colon carcinoma cell line; tansfected with: Myc siRNA; ', 'cell line: RKO; cell type: colon carcinoma cell line; tansfected with: SNTA1 siRNA; ', 'cell line: RKO; cell type: colon carcinoma cell line; tansfected with: KCNK1 siRNA; '

Short peptides (< 100 aa) have emerged as important regulators of development and physiology, but their identification has been limited by their size. We have leveraged the periodicity of ribosome movement on the mRNA to define actively translated ORFs by ribosome footprinting. This approach identifies several hundred translated small ORFs in zebrafish and human. Computational prediction of small ORFs from codon conservation patterns corroborates and extends these findings and identifies conserved sequences in zebrafish and human, suggesting functional peptide products (micropeptides). These results identify micropeptide‐encoding genes in vertebrates, providing an entry point to define their function in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53693	The EMBO journal	None	https://doi.org/10.1002/embj.201488411	{The EMBO journal (None) doi:10.1002/embj.201488411}; {The EMBO journal (None) doi:10.15252/embj.201592759}; 	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA232649	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA232649	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP034750	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling experiments at five timepoints across zebrafish development in WT embryos; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Embryos are incubated at 28C'; [Extraction]'For ribosome profiling, 50 wild type embryos for each condition were collected at a given stage.

The coupling of ribosomes to receptors has been proposed as a mechanism linking signals to local translation but it is not known how broadly this mechanism operates, nor whether it can selectively regulate mRNA translation. We report that receptor-ribosome coupling is employed by multiple guidance cue receptors and this interaction is mRNA-dependent. We find that different receptors bind to distinct sets of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Cue stimulation induces rapid dissociation of ribosomes from receptors and the selective translation of receptor-specific mRNAs in retinal axon growth cones. Further, we show that receptor-ribosome dissociation and cue-induced selective translation are inhibited by simultaneous exposure to translation-repressive cues, suggesting a novel mode of signal integration. Our findings reveal receptor-specific interactomes and provide a general model for the rapid, localized and selective control of cue-induced translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135338	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48718	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.48718}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA558460	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA558460	None	[Overal design]The profiling of mRNAs binding with DCC or Nrp1 in SH-SY5Y cells; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'The cells were cultured at 37C and 5% CO2 in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% FBS'; [Extraction]'The lysate of SH-SY5Y cells was incubated with magnetic Dynabeads pre-coupled with antibodies (mouse-anti-DCC (BD Biosciences, 554223); rabbit-anti-Nrp1 (Abcam, ab81321)) for 1.5 hours at 4°C.

GSE14784	Gallus gallus	8	Expression profiling by array	GPL7791	GATA3 overexpression in utricle sensory epithelia	2009-02-10	The inner ear utilizes sensory hair cells as mechano-electric transducers for sensing sound and balance. In mammals, these hair cells lack the capacity for regeneration. Unlike mammals, hair cells from non-mammalian vertebrates, such as birds, can be regenerated throughout the life of the organism making them a useful model for studying inner ear genetics pathways. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA3 is required for inner ear development and mutations cause sensory neural deafness in humans. In the avian cochlea GATA3 is expressed throughout the sensory epithelia; however, expression is limited to the striola of the utricle. The striola corresponds to an abrupt change in morphologically distinct hair cell types and a 180° shift in hair cell orientation. We used 3 complimentary approaches to identify potential downstream targets of GATA3 in the avian utricle. Specifically we used microarray expression profiling of GATA3 knockdown by siRNA and GATA3 over-expression treatments as well as direct comparisons of GATA3 expressing cells from the striola and non GATA3 expressing cells from the extra-striola.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14784	Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists	2.852	https://doi.org/10.1002/dvdy.22149	{Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists (2.852): 10.1002/dvdy.22149}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA114447	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA114447	None	[Overal design]Dissociated sensory epithelia were plated in 96 well cultures, 5 wells per sample. 4 days post plating, ~ 30% confluency, cells were transfected with a pMES vector containing an internal ribosome entry site regulating expression of GATA3 and eGFP under control of a chick beta-actin promoter.

GSE148636	Homo sapiens	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Dual targeting of DDX3 and eIF4A by the translation inhibitor rocaglamide A	2020-04-14	Small molecule compounds that sense the nucleic acid sequences, promise the attractive venue for drug development. Such an unusual effect has been observed in the natural product Rocaglamide A (RocA) from Aglaia plant, proving to exhibit anti-tumor effects by clamping eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A onto mRNA polypurine sequences. Although eIF4A has been speculated the unique target of RocA, the insensitization of eIF4A in human cells only partially rescued the translation repression from RocA, suggesting another alternative target of this compound. Here, we revealed that DDX3 is an alternative target of RocA. Developing a RocA derivative with an O-nitrobenzoxadiazole unit (RocA-O-NBD), which can covalently bind to proximate proteins and provide fluorescence to them, we identified DDX3 bound to RocA. As observed in eIF4A, RocA locked the DDX3 protein onto polypurine sequences of RNA in an ATP-independent manner. De novo assembled Aglaia plant transcriptome uncovered the natural amino acid substitutions in Aglaia DDX3 to protect itself from RocA toxicity. Because of the dominant negative effect of RocA, we also proved the protein abundance of eIF4A and DDX3 in cancer cells determines their sensitivity to RocA. Overall, this study discovered DDX3 as another target of RocA and suggests the probability to predict tumor toxicity of RocA by the target abundance.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148636	Cell chemical biology	6.762	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.11.008	{Cell chemical biology (6.762): 10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.11.008}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA625261	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA625261	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP256332	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling; [Treatment]'DMSO or RocA for 30min'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification (for ribosome profiling)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''treatment: DMSO; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H1650; ', 'treatment: DMSO; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H520; ', 'treatment: DMSO; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H521; ', 'treatment: DMSO; genetic background: WT; cell line: Hs 936.T; ', 'treatment: DMSO; genetic background: WT; cell line: A375; ', 'treatment: RocA 0.3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H1650; ', 'treatment: RocA 3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H1650; ', 'treatment: RocA 0.3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H520; ', 'treatment: RocA 3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: NCI-H521; ', 'treatment: RocA 0.3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: Hs 936.T; ', 'treatment: RocA 3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: Hs 936.T; ', 'treatment: RocA 0.3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: A375; ', 'treatment: RocA 3 microM; genetic background: WT; cell line: A375; '
GSE175554	Drosophila melanogaster	10	Other	GPL13304	Integrative genome-wide analysis of dopaminergic neuron-specific PARIS expression dissects recognition of multiple PPAR-γ associated gene regulation (TRAP-Seq).	2021-05-25	PURPOSE: The transcriptional repressor PARIS (ZNF746) was initially identified as a pathogenic co-substrate of PINK1 and parkin that leads to Parkinson’s disease (PD) by disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis through PPARγ coactivator -1α (PGC-1α) suppression. Later, accumulation of PARIS in dopamine (DA) neurons that cause neurotoxicity has been studied widely and growing evidence has linked defective mitochondrial biogenesis to PD pathogenesis. Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings of this link remain elusive. METHODS: We employed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) followed by RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) for transcriptome profiling of DA neurons in transgenic Drosophila lines we generated expressing human PARIS or human PARIS mutant (C571A). Together with TRAP control and whole brain samples, this data set is composed of a total of 10 (3, 3, 3, and 1 respectively) replicate samples representing 4 different treatment groups for a set of gene-level (a parametric F-test) and transcript-level (a Wald test or a likelihood ratio test) differential expression analysis. RESULTS: Firstly, we identified differentially expressed genes by human PARIS in fly DA neurons successfully. Then, we showed that PPARγ acts as a master regulator of transcriptomic changes induced by PARIS in the clusters of Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Also, we validated this finding in human neuroblastoma cell line. CONCLUSION: PPARγ plays a crucial regulatory role in PARIS phenotype. Drosophila models of PARIS-induced neurodegeneration used in this work to represent PD phenotype and our TRAP-seq protocol serve as a paradigm for future studies to unravel mechanistic underpinnings of PARIS biology.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE175554	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA732783	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA732783	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP321450	[Overal design]TRAP control (3X), PARIS wild type (3X), PARIS mutant (C571A) (3X), and whole brain (1X) samples, adding up to a total of 10 replicate samples representing 4 different groups.

Here, we show that a pseudouridine-driven posttranscriptional program steers translation control to impact stem cell commitment during early embryogenesis. Mechanistically, the pseudouridine ‘writer’ PUS7 modifies and activates a network of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) targeting the translation initiation complex. PUS7 inactivation in embryonic stem cells impairs tRF-mediated translational regulation leading to high protein biosynthesis and abnormal germ layer specification. Dysregulation of PUS7 and tRFs in myeloid malignancies associates with altered translation rates, suggesting a role of pseudouridine in tumorigenesis.

GSE133315	Homo sapiens	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	C6orf203 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis	2019-06-25	In all biological systems, RNAs are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), forming complexes that control gene regulatory mechanisms, from RNA synthesis to decay. In mammalian mitochondria, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is conducted by mitochondrial RBPs (mt-RBPs) at various stages of mt-RNA metabolism, including polycistronic transcript production, its processing into individual transcripts, mt-RNA modifications, stability, translation, and degradation. To date, only a handful of mt-RBPs have been characterized. Here, we describe a putative human mitochondrial protein, C6orf203, that contains an S4-like domain - an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding domain previously identified in proteins involved in translation. Our data show C6orf203 to bind highly-structured RNA in vitro and associate with the mitoribosomal large subunit in HEK293T cells. Knockout of C6orf203 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation and consequent OXPHOS deficiency, without affecting mitochondrial RNA levels. Although mitoribosome stability is not affected in C6orf203-depleted cells, mitoribosome profiling analysis revealed a global disruption of the association of mt-mRNAs with the mitoribosome, suggesting that C6orf203 may be required for the proper maturation and functioning of the mitoribosome. We therefore propose C6orf203 to be a novel RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial translation, expanding the repertoire of factors engaged in this process.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133315	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz684	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkz684}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA551033	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA551033	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP212089	[Overal design]Mitochondrial Ribosome profiling RNASeq data of Mitochondrial ribosomal profling from C6orf203 knock-out HEK cells versus wildtype; [Treatment]'Generation of HEK293T knockout cell line for C6orf203 was performed using CRISPR/Cas9 system.

Here, we extend the global steady-state measurements to additional mammalian contexts and find that regardless of the miRNA, cell type, growth condition, or translational state, mRNA destabilization explains most (66%–>90%) miRNA-mediated repression. We also determine the relative dynamics of translational repression and mRNA destabilization for endogenous mRNAs as a miRNA is induced. Although translational repression occurs rapidly, its effect is relatively weak, such that by the time consequential repression ensues, the effect of mRNA destabilization dominates. These results imply that consequential miRNA-mediated repression is largely irreversible and provide other insights into the nature of miRNA-mediated regulation. They also simplify future studies, dramatically extending the known contexts and time points for which monitoring mRNA changes captures most of the direct miRNA effects.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60426	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.028	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.028}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA258219	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA258219	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP045501	[Overal design]85 samples from a variety of cell types and species; [Treatment]'RNA-seq: For most samples, cytoplasmically-enriched RNA was extracted, poly(A)-selected, randomly fragmented by partial alkaline hydrolysis and then size-selected RNA fragments were used for library preparation In the case of B cells total RNA was extracted and then poly(A)-selected.

This study identifies HuR as a major repressor during adipogenesis. Knockdown and overexpression of HuR in primary adipocyte culture enhances and inhibits adipogenesis in vitro, respectively. Fat-specific knockout of HuR significantly enhances adipogenic gene program in all three major adipose tissues including epidydimal, inguinal white and brown adipose tissue, accompanied with systemic glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of HuR in adipose tissue prevents the HFD induced obesity by repressing adipogenesis. Mechanistically, HuR may inhibit adipogenesis by recognizing and modulating the stability of hundreds of adipocyte transcripts, including the mRNA of Insig1, a negative regulator during adipogenesis. Taken together, our work establishes HuR as a novel posttranscriptional regulator of adipogenesis and provides a new insight into how RNA processing contributes to adipocyte development.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124279	Nature communications	11.878	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-14001-8	{Nature communications (11.878): 10.1038/s41467-019-14001-8}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA511455	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA511455	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP174218	[Overal design]8 samples were included.

GSE116082	Mus musculus	10	Other	GPL13112	The androgen receptor regulates a druggable translational regulon in advanced prostate cancer [ribosome profiling]	2018-06-20	The recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the unfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non-neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (AR low CRPC) is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The mechanisms that promote this phenotype remain poorly understood. Through molecular studies of murine and human models of AR low CRPC, we have identified a new functional interface between the androgen receptor and the translation initiation complex inhibitor 4EBP1. AR directly regulates 4EBP1 expression which translationally represses eIF4F complex formation and a pro-proliferation program. In the context of AR low prostate cancer, de-repression of translation initiation drives the aberrant expression of the pro-proliferation regulon which fuels uncontrolled cell growth. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream eIF4F translation initiation complex reverses the proliferation phenotype in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a new previously unrecognized druggable nexus which functionally link the processes of mRNA transcription and translation initiation in a rapidly emerging class of advanced lethal prostate cancer	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116082	Science translational medicine	17.161	https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw4993	{Science translational medicine (17.161): 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw4993}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA476979	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA476979	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP151006	[Overal design]Androgen receptor low prostate cancer has been on the rise with the advent of potent androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis inhibitors and is uniformly fatal. The mechanisms underlying disease progression remains unresolved. We have identified a previously unknown direct interaction between the androgen receptor and the translation initiation complex inhibitor 4EBP1 which plays a critical role in protein synthesis rates, mRNA specific translation, and disease progression in vivo. This is mediated through the hyperactivation of the downstream eIF4F translation initiation complex which usurps a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs. Importantly, using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program leading to tumor regression. As such, we have identified a new therapeutic paradigm for targeting lethal androgen receptor low prostate cancer.

Despite of considerable advance in molecular classification of GBMs, no improvements in therapy have been described. The scenario is further complicated by tumor heterogeneity and the relationship among genetic, transcriptional and functional findings. Classically, gene expression has been evaluated by steady-state mRNA, however, this does not take translational control into consideration, which contributes considerably to the composition of the proteome. In this study, we evaluated the transcriptomic and translatomic signature of a GBM obtained from a single patient focusing in tumor heterogeneity. In a sampling of eight fragments, we investigated the translation rates, mTORC1 and ERK1/2 pathways and identified both total and polysome associated mRNAs. An increased translation rate was observed in fragments with high-grade histological features. High-grade histology was also associated with the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis, in both transcriptomes and translatomes. However, genes associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stress response, were observed only in translatomes from high-grade fragments. Overall, our results demonstrate that isolation of translated mRNA can be used to identify biomarkers and reveal previously unrecognized determinants of heterogeneity in GBMs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130220	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA534298	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA534298	None	[Overal design]Six histologically distinct fragments from a secondary glioblastoma, which were classified as high- or low-grade, by an experienced pathologist according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System.

In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells.

The unstructured N-terminal tail (NTT) of yeast eIF1A deploys five basic residues to contact tRNAi, mRNA, or 18S rRNA exclusively in the closed state. Interestingly, EIF1AX mutations altering the human eIF1A NTT are associated with uveal melanoma (UM). We found that substituting all five basic residues, and seven UM-associated substitutions, in yeast eIF1A suppresses initiation at near-cognate UUG codons and AUGs in poor context. Ribosome profiling of NTT substitution R13P reveals heightened discrimination against unfavorable AUG context genome-wide. Both R13P and K16D substitutions destabilize the closed complex at UUG codons in reconstituted PICs. Thus, electrostatic interactions involving the eIF1A NTT stabilize the closed conformation and promote utilization of suboptimal start codons. We predict UM-associated mutations alter human gene expression by increasing discrimination against poor initiation sites.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE108334	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31250	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.31250}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA423281	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA423281	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP127274	[Overal design]We examined the effect of tif11-R13P on global translational efficiencies (TEs) by ribosome footprint profiling of isogenic WT and tif11-R13P strains.

GSE33674	Mus musculus	20	Expression profiling by array	GPL6193	Preservation of cone photoreceptors after a rapid yet transient degeneration and remodeling in cone-only Nrl-/- mouse retina	2011-11-14	Cone photoreceptors are the primary initiator of visual transduction in the human retina. Dysfunction or death of rod photoreceptors precedes cone loss in many retinal and macular degenerative diseases, suggesting a rod-dependent trophic support for cone survival. Rod differentiation and homeostasis are dependent on the basic motif leucine zipper transcription factor NRL. The loss of Nrl in mice (Nrl-/-) results in a retina with predominantly S-opsin containing cones that exhibit molecular and functional characteristics of WT cones. Here we report that Nrl-/- retina undergoes a rapid but transient period of degeneration in early adulthood, with cone apoptosis, retinal detachment, alterations in retinal vessel structure, and activation and translocation of retinal microglia. However, cone degeneration stabilizes by four months of age, resulting in a thinned but intact outer nuclear layer with residual cones expressing S- and M-opsins and a preserved photopic ERG. At this stage, microglia translocate back to the inner retina and reacquire a quiescent morphology. Gene profiling analysis during the period of transient degeneration reveals misregulation of stress response and inflammation genes, implying their involvement in cone death. The Nrl-/- retina illustrates the long-term viability of cones in the absence of rods and may serve as a model for elucidating mechanisms of cone homeostasis and degeneration that would be relevant to understanding diseases of the cone-dominant human macula.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE33674	The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience	6.074	https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3591-11.2012	{The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience (6.074): 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3591-11.2012}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA148293	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA148293	None	[Overal design]Targets were generated from a pair of retinas (one Nrl-/- mouse) per biological replicate.

GSE71893	Homo sapiens	8	Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	AKT Inhibition Promotes Non-autonomous Cancer Cell Survival [Cellular small RNA-Seq]	2015-08-10	Small-molecule inhibitors of AKT signaling are being in evaluated in patients with various cancer types, but have so far proven therapeutically disappointing for reasons that remain unclear. Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71893	Molecular cancer therapeutics	4.856	https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414	{Molecular cancer therapeutics (4.856): 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292423	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292423	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP062227	[Overal design]Profiles of MCF7 and HCT116 Akti-1/2 treated cells and MCF7 and HCT116 vehicle (i.e. DMSO) treated cells were generated, each in duplicate, using small RNA-Seq.; [Treatment]'Cells were treated for 72h with vehicle (DMSO), Akti-1/2 inhibitor (HCT116: 20µM; MCF7: 2µM) (Sigma)'; [Growth]'MCF7 was maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 40mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin; HCT116 was maintained in McCoy’s 5α medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin.

They mainly act via regulating gene transcription. However, control of mRNA translation by GC has never been assessed systematically. In our research, T- and precursor B-ALL cells were cultured with and without GC for 6 hours and subjected to translational profiling, a technique combining sucrose gradient fractionation and microarray analysis of mRNA in different fractions. Analysis of GC regulation in different pools revealed no significant differences in regulation of mRNA translation by GC, suggesting no evidence for translational regulation by GC. Ribosome profiling by sucrose gradient fractionation followed by microarray analysis of RNA from 3 distinct pools representing free RNA (pool 1), RNA in small protein-RNA complexes or bound to single ribosomes (pool 2) and RNA from large protein-RNA complexes (polysomes, pool 3).

The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59094	Scientific reports	4.011	https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25996	{Scientific reports (4.011): 10.1038/srep25996}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA254362	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA254362	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP044063	[Overal design]Examination of RNA targets od endogenous DDX3X; [Treatment]'Cells were seeded in 10 cm dish and harvested 24 hr later to obtain protein extracts.

We identified METTL3 as an essential gene for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell growth in two distinct genetic screens. Down-regulation of METTL3 results in cell cycle arrest, differentiation of leukemic cells and failure to establish leukemia in immunodeficient mice. We show that METTL3, independently of METTL14, associates with chromatin and localizes to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of 83 active genes. The vast majority of these genes have a CAATT-box motif at their TSS, are occupied by a specific set of transcription factors including NFY, WDR5, KLF9 and they harbor specific histone modifications (e.g. H3R2me2s). Promoter bound METTL3 induces m6A modification within the coding region of the associated mRNA transcript and it enhances translation due to relief of ribosome stalling. We show that genes regulated by METTL3 in this way are necessary for AML-leukemia. Together, these data define a new mechanism of gene regulation by METTL3 and identify this enzyme as a novel therapeutic target for AML.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94613	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature24678	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature24678}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA', 'genomic DNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA371833	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA371833	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP099081	"[Overal design]This experiment contains data for 3 high-throughput sequencing experiments; ChIP seq, m6A RNA IP seq and Riboprofiling.

GSE53187	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by array	GPL6480	Transcriptome and translatome profiling of CPX 24h effects in neuroblastoma cells CHP134	2013-12-10	Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequent extracranial solid tumour of childhood. Clinical courses are highly variable, ranging from spontaneous regression/maturation to rapid progression despite intensive multimodal therapy. The estimation of 5-year event free survival in high-risk patients of only about 40 % stresses an importance of novel therapeutic strategies. A number of iron chelators have demonstrated marked in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity and are currently being developed as novel anti-cancer agents. Therefore, the potential antitumor effect of iron chelators in NB cancer was investigated. Among the compounds tested, ciclopirox olamine (CPX) was shown to be one of the most effective intracellular iron chelators in NB cells. To unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CPX on viability of NB cells, microarray analysis was performed in CHP134 control cells and cells treated with 5 µM CPX for 24 hours. Inclusion of both total RNA (reflecting transcriptional status of the cells) and polysomal RNA (approximating the proteomic representation of the cells) provided us with a deeper understanding of changes in the cells upon CPX treatment.

Overexpression of protein subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has been associated with increased translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation. In addition to playing a major role in general translation initiation by serving as a scaffold for the assembly of translation initiation complexes, eIF3 regulates translation of specific cellular mRNAs and viral RNAs. Mutations in the N-terminal Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) RNA-binding motif of the EIF3A subunit in eIF3 interfere with Hepatitis C Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) mediated translation initiation in vitro. Here we use RNA-seq and ribosome profiling of engineered lentiviral HEK293T cells to show that the EIF3A HLH motif controls translation of a small set of cellular transcripts enriched in oncogenic mRNAs, including MYC.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118239	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA484941	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA484941	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP156569	"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis of control and EIF3A triple mutant HEK293T cells in biological triplicates.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Lentiviral engineered HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM media with 10% FBS.

GSE122071	Homo sapiens	11	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL20301	Cap-specific terminal N6-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase.	2018-11-01	N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a major modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), plays critical roles in RNA metabolism and function. In addition to the internal m6A, N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive. Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified PCIF1, a factor that interacts with the serine-5-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, as a cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase (CAPAM) responsible for N6-methylation of m6Am. The crystal structure of CAPAM in complex with substrates revealed the molecular basis of cap-specific m6A formation. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that N6-methylation of m6Am promotes the translation of capped mRNAs. Thus, a cap-specific m6A writer promotes translation of mRNAs starting from m6Am.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE122071	Science (New York, N.Y.)	41.037	https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav0080	{Science (New York, N.Y.)

Through unbiased proteomic analyses in erythroid cells, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a reciprocal pattern to BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes. We show that the observed suppression of BCL11A protein translation is mediated by LIN28B through a direct interaction with BCL11A mRNA and independent of its role in let-7 microRNA biogenesis.

Ribosomal complexes were separated on 12ml 10-50% sucrose gradients (in a buffer containing 20mM Tris pH7.4, 75 mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mg/ml cycloheximide, and 1mM DTT) by centrifugation at 4°C and 35,000rpm for 3h in a SW41 rotor.  Fractions were collected at 0.5ml/min with continuous monitoring of conductivity and UV absorption at 254nm.  Fractions containing 80S monosomes were diluted with an equal amount of RNase-free water followed by organic extraction with Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamylalkohol 25:24:1 (Roth) and ethanol precipitation.  RNAs were then separated by denaturing Urea-PAGE and visualized by SYBR Gold staining.  RNAs with a length of 27-33nt were excised from the gel and eluted overnight in a buffer containing 300mM NaOAc pH 5.5, 1mM EDTA, and 0.25% SDS followed by ethanol precipitation.\nRNA-Seq  Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nRibo-Seq  After dephosphorylation for 1h at 37°C with 20U of T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB), RNAs were ligated to a universal miRNA cloning linker (NEB) using truncated T4 RNA ligase 2.  After gelpurification reverse transcription was performed using SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase and a primer complementary to the ligated adapter, followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA strand.  The resulting cDNAs were gelpurified and contaminating sequences originating from rRNA were depleted by substractive hybridization to a mixture of biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides and Streptavidin magnetic beads (New England Biolabs).  The recovered RNAs were then circularized with CircLigase II ssDNA Ligase (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to PCR amplification to generate amplicons suitable for Illumina sequencing.  After gelpurification, DNA concentration was determined using a Qubit Fluorometer (Qubit 2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Bioanalyzer or TapeStation (Agilent) analyses were performed to assess the quality of the samples followed by deep sequencing on the Illumina platform.\nRNA-Seq  RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and concentration was measured with Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies).  Starting with ~300ng of total RNA as input, ribosomal RNA was removed by NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (New England Biolabs).  Subsequently, stranded total RNA-seq libraries were prepared from rRNA free RNA sample using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England Biolabs) according to the protocol.  RNA-seq barcoded libraries that passed the QC step, which was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer system, were then pooled in equimolar amounts;  1.8 pM solution of this pool was loaded on the Illumina sequencer NextSeq 500 and sequenced bi-directionally.'; [Cell type]'Astrocytoma-derived p53-deficient glial cells''cell line: LN308; cell type: Astrocytoma-derived p53-deficient glial cells; time: 0 h; treatment: untreated; ', 'cell line: LN308; cell type: Astrocytoma-derived p53-deficient glial cells; time: 2 h; treatment: tunicamycin; ', 'cell line: LN308; cell type: Astrocytoma-derived p53-deficient glial cells; time: 6 h; treatment: tunicamycin; ', 'cell line: LN308; cell type: Astrocytoma-derived p53-deficient glial cells; time: 2 h; treatment: thapsigargin; ', 'cell line: LN308; cell type: Astrocytoma-derived p53-deficient glial cells; time: 6 h; treatment: thapsigargin; '
GSE143415	Homo sapiens	200	Other; Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Co-existence of compulsory and plastic rRNA 2'-O-Methylation sites in human breast tumours	2020-01-10	Emerging evidence suggests that changes in ribosomal RNA 2’O-ribose methylation (rRNA 2’OMe) in the human ribosome play a key role in regulating translation thereby contributing in setting particular phenotypes such as hallmarks of cancer cells. Here, by analysing the rRNA 2’OMe in a large series of 195 human primary breast tumours using the RiboMETH-seq approach we have identified the positions within the rRNA molecules which can tolerate the absence of 2’OMe in humans. The frequency of rRNA 2’OMe at some positions is highly stable between individuals (termed “stable”) whereas it can vary substantially at other positions (termed “variant”). Differential association of rRNA 2’OMe with breast cancer features, evolution and structure/function characteristics suggest the stable positions showing a low inter-variability might be required to maintain the core structure and thus the function of the ribosome – representing compulsory rRNA 2’OMe positions. In contrast, the variant positions displaying high inter-variability might be the source of regulatory events – representing plastic rRNA 2’OMe positions. Therefore our data issued from rRNA 2’OMe profiling of a large-scale human sample series bring the first compelling evidence to resolve two divergent long lasting visions of the role of rRNA 2’O-Me and sustain the emerging role of the ribosome plasticity in regulating translation in cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143415	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA600412	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA600412	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP241165	[Overal design]rRNA 2'OMe profiling in a series of 195 primary breast tumours; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNAeasy kit (Qiagen)\nTotal RNA was first subjected to partial alkaline hydrolysis to generate RNA fragments ranging from 50 to 100 bp.

RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its mRNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5′ UTRs that are very dependent on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. Here, we show that secondary structure in 5′ UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A activity. Rather, in vitro and in vivo, RocA clamps eIF4A onto a specific sequence motif even after ATP hydrolysis. This artificially clamped eIF4A blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature, upstream translation initiation and reducing gene expression on transcripts bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence. In elucidating the mechanism of this lead anti-cancer compound and explaining its mRNA selectivity, we provide the first example of a drug stabilizing sequence-specific RNA-protein interactions.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70211	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17978	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/nature17978}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA287879	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA287879	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP059825	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling, mRNA-Seq, RIP-Seq, and Bind-n-Seq Ribosome profiling for sample 1-5, and 11-15.

GSE133393	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL20301	Genome-wide survey of ribosome collision [monosome/disome]	2019-06-27	In protein synthesis, ribosome movement is not always smooth, rather often impeded by numerous reasons. Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3′ UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133393	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107610	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107610}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA551384	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA551384	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP212162	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction\nRNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification for ribosome profiling'; [Cell type]'Source: ''genotype: WT; cell line: HEK293; '

We report ac4C-seq, a chemical genomic method for single-nucleotide resolution, transcriptome-wide quantitative mapping of ac4C. While we did not find detectable ac4C sites in human and yeast mRNAs, ac4C was induced via ectopic overexpression of eukaryotic acetyltransferase complexes, invariably at a conserved sequence motif. In contrast, cross-evolutionary profiling reveals unprecedented levels of ac4C across hundreds of residues in rRNA, tRNA, ncRNA and mRNA from hyperthermophilic archaea. Ac4C is dramatically induced in response to temperature, and acetyltransferase-deficient archaeal strains exhibit temperature-dependent growth defects. Cryo-EM visualization of WT and acetyltransferase-deficient archaeal ribosomes furnishes structural insights into the temperature-dependent distribution of ac4C and its potential thermoadaptive role. Our studies quantitatively define the ac4C landscape, providing a technical and conceptual foundation for unravelling this modification’s role in biology and disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135826	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2418-2	{Nature (43.070): 10.1038/s41586-020-2418-2}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA560218	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA560218	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP218339	"[Overal design]polyA-enriched RNA from HEK-293T WT (single sample) or Nat10+Thumpd1 overexpressing (2 replicates) cells under NaCNBH3, deacetylation or mock treatment.

GSE145046	Homo sapiens	30	Other	GPL16791	Decoding mRNA translatability and stability from 5’ UTR	2020-02-10	Precise control of protein synthesis by engineering sequence elements in 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) remains a fundamental challenge. To accelerate our understanding of cis-regulatory code embedded in 5’UTR, we devised massively parallel reporter assays from a synthetic mRNA library composed of over one million 5’UTR variants. A completely randomized 10-nucleotide sequence preceding an upstream open reading frame (uORF) and downstream GFP leads to a broad range of mRNA translatability and stability in mammalian cells. While efficient translation protects mRNA from degradation, uORF translation triggers mRNA decay in a UPF1-dependent manner. We also identified translational inhibitory elements in 5’UTR with G-quadruplex as a mark for mRNA decay in the P-body. Unexpectedly, an unstructured A-rich element in 5’UTR, while enabling cap-independent translation, destabilizes mRNAs in the absence of translation. Our results not only expose diverse sequence features of 5’UTR in controlling mRNA translatability, but also reveal ribosome-dependent and -independent mRNA surveillance pathways.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145046	Nature structural & molecular biology	12.109	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-0465-x	{Nature structural & molecular biology (12.109): 10.1038/s41594-020-0465-x}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA605796	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA605796	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP247978	[Overal design]To accelerate our understanding of cis-regulatory code embedded in 5’UTR of mRNA, we devised a high-throughput uORF reporter assay from a synthetic mRNA library composed of over one million 5’UTR variants.

GSE110867	Mus musculus	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13112	Identification and validation of GPD1 as an essential cancer stem cell specific target in glioblastoma (RNA-seq: NSC vs BTSC)	2018-02-20	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, however, little is known about how to target CSCs without affecting the normal stem cell population. Here we report the ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells and brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which leads to the identification of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) as a CSC- specific determinant. We confirmed that GPD1 is expressed in BTSCs but not in neural stem cells. Intriguingly, expression of GPD1 is only found in the infiltrating dormant BTSCs in vivo and these cells start to divide and drive tumour relapse after chemotherapy. Most importantly, inhibition of GPD1 expression in tumour-bearing mice leads to prolonged survival. Further analysis shows that loss of GPD1 results in widespread changes in important pathways affecting BTSC maintenance. Human patient data analysis suggests that GPD1 is expressed in the dormant infiltrating tumour cells in human glioblastoma and the expression level is associated with a worse prognosis. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumours and a novel aspect of regulation of CSC dormancy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110867	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA434717	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA434717	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP133176	[Overal design]Two neural stem cells and two brain tumor stem cells are used in RNA-seq experiments; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'For RNA isolation from cultured NSCs, BTSCs and cells were harvested in TRI Reagent (Sigma) following the protocol.\nAfter chloroform phase separation the transparent upper phase was added to an equal volume of 70 % ethanol and transferred to an RNeasy Mini spin column (Qiagen).

GSE85864	Homo sapiens	32	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	Ribosome profiling of human platelets, reticulocytes, and in vitro cell lines	2016-08-19	Translation is a fundamental biological process and ribosomes are essential in all cells, but defects in ribosome biogenesis (ribosomopathies) disproportionately cause hematopoietic dysfunction of red blood cells and platelets. Here, we analyze translation in primary human reticulocytes and platelets by ribosome profiling and uncover dramatic accumulation of post-termination, unrecycled ribosomes in the 3´UTRs of mRNAs. We then demonstrate that these ribosomes accumulate as a result of the natural loss of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 during terminal differentiation. We find that induction of ribosome rescue factors PELO and HBS1L is required to maintain translational homeostasis when ABCE1 levels fall. This activation of ribosome rescue mitigates the effects of ribosome shortage on translational output, including on hemoglobin production. Our observations suggest that this distinctive loss of ABCE1 in anucleate blood lineages sensitizes them to defects in ribosome homeostasis and that activation of a ribosome rescue pathway plays a lineage-specific role in maintaining ribosome homeostasis during blood cell development.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85864	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.088	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.088}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA339577	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA339577	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP082436	[Overal design]Analysis of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data from primary human platelets, primary human reticulocytes, in vitro derived platelet-like particles, and hemin-induced differentiation of K562 cells; manipulation by knockdown and overexpression of Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L in K562 cells and Meg01/platelet-like particles.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Samples were extracted as described previously in Ingolia et al., 2014\nRibosome profiling libraries were prepared as described previously in Ingolia et al., 2014'; [Cell type]'primary cell type', 'cell line''cell type: primary cell type; drug treatment: vehicle; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: primary cell type; drug treatment: 0.01U/ml thrombin for 60 min at 37C - replicate 1; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: primary cell type; drug treatment: 0.01U/ml thrombin for 60 min at 37C - replicate 2; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: primary cell type; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: primary cell type; rrna depletion: Globin RNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: untreated - 0 days - replicate 1; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: untreated - 0 days - replicate 2; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: 50 micromolar hemin - replicate 1; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: 50 micromolar hemin - replicate 2; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: untreated - 0 days; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: 50 micromolar hemin - 2 days; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: 50 micromolar hemin - 4 days; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'cell type: cell line; drug treatment: 50 micromolar hemin - 6 days; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; '

Recent studies show that mTORC1 is particularly sensitive to arginine and leucine status, with a deprivation of these amino acids leading to a strong inhibition of mTORC1 that prevents the phosphorylation and inactivation of the translational repressor 4EBP1. Though amino acids are known regulators of translation, the effects that deficiencies of specific amino acids have on translation have yet to be determined. We demonstrate that deprivation of leucine or methionine results in large inhibitory effects on translation initiation and on polysome formation that are not replicated by overexpressing non-phosphorylatable 4EBP1 or a phosphomimetic eIF2α. Our results demonstrate that a lack of either leucine or methionine has a major impact on mRNA translation, though they act by quite different mechanisms. Leucine deprivation appears to primarily inhibit ribosome loading, whereas methionine deprivation appears to primarily impair start site recognition. These data point to a unique regulatory effect that methionine status has on translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112643	Scientific reports	4.011	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26254-2	{Scientific reports (4.011): 10.1038/s41598-018-26254-2}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA448601	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA448601	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP137018	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of single Amino acid starvation; [Treatment]'Experimental control medium was the same as normal growth medium with the following changes: medium was prepared using DMEM that lacked sulfur amino acids, histidine, leucine and arginine (custom prepared by Gibco/Invitrogen) and was supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and L-cysteine, L-methionine, L-histidine, L-leucine and L-arginine to levels found in normal DMEM.

GSE122869	Homo sapiens	3	Other	GPL15520	The RNA-binding ubiquitin ligase MKRN1 functions in ribosome-associated quality control of poly(A)-translation	2018-11-23	Human cells have evolved quality control mechanisms to ensure protein homeostasis by detecting and degrading aberrant mRNAs and protein products. A common source of aberrant mRNAs is premature polyadenylation, which can result in non-functional protein products. Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, followed by ribosome recycling and rapid decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Here, we demonstrate that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at continuous A-tracts during RQC. Using individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), we show that MKRN1 is positioned upstream of A-rich stretches and poly(A) tails in mRNAs through an interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Ubiquitin remnant profiling uncovered PABP and ribosomal protein RPS10 as well as additional translational regulators as main substrates of MRKN1. We propose that MKRN1 serves as a first line of poly(A) recognition at the mRNA level to prevent production of erroneous proteins, thus maintaining proteome integrity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE122869	Genome biology	14.028	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1814-0	{Genome biology (14.028): 10.1186/s13059-019-1814-0}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA506725	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA506725	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP170545	[Overal design]iCLIP experiments for GFP-MKRN1 with crosslinking at 254 nm and with 4SU and crosslinking at 365 nm; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'GFP-MKRN1 was transiently overexpressed in HEK293T cells for 48h.'; [Extraction]'HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP-MKRN1 were lysed in 1ml lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation as described on previously published protocol (Huppertz et al., 2014; Sutandy et al., 2016)\nin vivo iCLIP libraries were prepared from HEK293Tcells overexpressing GFP-MKRN1 according to the previously published protocol (Huppertz et al., 2014; Sutandy et al., 2016).

GSE22871	Mus musculus	30	Expression profiling by array	GPL1261	Expression data from wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)	2010-07-09	Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and a persistent environmental contaminant found in the tissues of humans and wildlife. Although blood levels of PFOS have begun to decline, health concerns remain because of the long half-life of PFOS in humans. Like other PFAAs, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) and exhibits hepatocarcinogenic potential in rodents. PFOS is also a developmental toxicant in rodents where, unlike PFOA, it’s mode of action is independent of PPARα. Wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null (Null) mice were dosed with 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day PFOS for 7 days. Animals were euthanized, livers weighed, and liver samples collected for histology and preparation of total RNA. Gene profiling was conducted using Affymetrix 430_2 microarrays. In WT mice, PFOS induced changes that were characteristic of PPARα transactivation including regulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis, proteasome activation, and inflammation. PPARα-independent changes were indicated in both WT and Null mice by altered expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and xenobiotic metabolism. Such results are similar to prior studies done with PFOA and are consistent with modest activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and possibly PPARγ and/or PPARβ/δ. Unique treatment-related effects were also found in Null mice including altered expression of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Of interest was up-regulation of Cyp7a1, a gene which is under the control of various transcription regulators. Hence, in addition to its ability to modestly activate PPARα, PFOS induces a variety of “off-target” effects as well.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22871	PPAR research	4.186	https://doi.org/10.1155/2010/794739	{PPAR research (4.186): 10.1155/2010/794739}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA128117	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA128117	None	[Overal design]PPARalpha-null and wild-type male mice at 6-9 months of age were dosed by gavage for 7 consecutive days with either 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg PFOS (potassium salt) in 0.5% Tween 20.

GSE99745	Homo sapiens	18	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	RNA-Seq of polysome profiling fractions and whole cell lysates of UVB-irradiated N-TERT keratinocytes	2017-06-06	In response to UVB irradiation, human keratinocytes transiently block cell cycle progression to allow ample time for DNA repair and cell fate determination. These cellular processes are important for evading the initiation of carcinogenesis in skin. We previously showed that repression of mRNA translation initiation through phosphorylation of eIF2α (eIF2α-P) protects keratinocytes from UVB-induced apoptosis. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism of eIF2α-P cytoprotection in response to UVB. Loss of eIF2α-P induced by UVB diminished G1 arrest, DNA repair rate, and cellular senescence coincident with enhanced cell death in human keratinocytes. Genome-wide translation analyses revealed that the mechanism for these critical changes directed by eIF2α-P involved induced expression of CDKN1A encoding p21 protein. p21 is a major regulator of the cell cycle, and we show that human CDKN1A mRNA splice variant 4 is preferentially translated by eIF2α-P during stress in a mechanism mediated in part by upstream ORFs situated in the 5’-leader of CDKN1A mRNA. We conclude that eIF2α-P is cytoprotective in response to UVB by a mechanism featuring translation of a specific splice variant of CDKN1A that facilitates G1 arrest and subsequent DNA repair.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99745	Molecular biology of the cell	3.905	https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E17-06-0362	{Molecular biology of the cell (3.905): 10.1091/mbc.E17-06-0362}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA389466	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA389466	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP108720	[Overal design]Untreated and irradiated N-TERT keratinocytes are split into 3 groups: monosome fraction, polysome fraction, and whole cell lysate.

GSE139130	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL17342	Selective Translation Complex Profiling in yeast and human Reveals Staged Initiation and Co-translational  Assembly of Initiation Factor Complexes [Yeast]	2019-10-20	Translational control targeting mainly the initiation phase is central to the regulation of gene expression. Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological advancements. Here we modified yeast Translational Complex Profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adopted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ses) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ses), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ses distribute similarly across 5’UTRs indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed a variation called Selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq) enabling selection for 40Ses and 80Ses associated with an immuno-targeted factor in yeast and human. Sel- TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5’UTRs with scanning 40Ses to successively dissociate upon start codon recognition. Manifesting the Sel-TCP-seq versatility for gene expression studies, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139130	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.004	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.004}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA578566	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA578566	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP226388	[Overal design]3 sets; set1: 3 replicates for 40S and 80S TCP-seq, 1 replicate for each eIF3a, eIF3c and eIF2beta bound 40S Sel-TCP-seq and 1 replicate each for eIF3a and eIF3c bound 80S Sel-TCP-seq (1-1, 1-2, 1-3); set2+3: 2 more replicates (in addition to set1) of 80S TCP-seq and eIF3a bound 80S Sel-TCP-seq (2-1, 3-1); [Treatment]'incubation of the cell culture with 0.8 % w/v formaldehyde on ice for 1 h'; [Growth]'in 1 litre YPD at 30ºC up to OD600 of ~0.7-0.8'; [Extraction]'cell lysis with bead beater, RNase I digestion to generate ribosomal footprints, 40S/80S separation (followed by Co-IP if indicated), hot acid phenol RNA extraction\nlibrary construction according to Ingolia et al., 2010, Methods Enzymol (different RNA fragment size selection, different set of rRNA depletion oligos)', 'cell lysis with bead beater, total RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini Kit, poly(A) selection with poly(A)Purist MAG Kit, fragmentation\nlibrary construction according to Ingolia et al., 2010, Methods Enzymol (different RNA fragment size selection, different set of rRNA depletion oligos)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''strain: SY182 (eIF3a/TIF32-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'strain: H25 (eIF3c/NIP1-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'strain: SY194 (eIF2beta/SUI3-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'strain: SY182 (eIF3a/TIF32-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: yes (anti-FLAG, Sigma A2220); protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'strain: H25 (eIF3c/NIP1-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: yes (anti-FLAG, Sigma A2220); protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'strain: SY194 (eIF2beta/SUI3-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: yes (anti-FLAG, Sigma A2220); protocol: RNA 40S footprint; ', 'strain: SY182 (eIF3a/TIF32-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA 80S footprint; ', 'strain: H25 (eIF3c/NIP1-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA 80S footprint; ', 'strain: SY194 (eIF2beta/SUI3-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA 80S footprint; ', 'strain: SY182 (eIF3a/TIF32-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: yes (anti-FLAG, Sigma A2220); protocol: RNA 80S footprint; ', 'strain: H25 (eIF3c/NIP1-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: yes (anti-FLAG, Sigma A2220); protocol: RNA 80S footprint; ', 'strain: SY182 (eIF3a/TIF32-FLAG); rna fragment size selection: approximately 18 to 85; co-ip: no; protocol: RNA-seq; '

GSE48785	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Global response to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis	2013-07-11	Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to explore how cancer cells struggle with a chemotherapeutic drug prior to succumbing to apoptosis. As a model system we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line clinical treatment. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes following bortezomib treatment. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of changes at the transcriptional level. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. As suggested by these data, we find that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic response regulator HSF1 promotes cell death by bortezomib. Thus, monitoring global cellular dynamics after chemotherapy offers in-depth insight into apoptosis and can also guide potential therapeutic combinations.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48785	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01236	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.01236}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA211752	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA211752	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP027015	[Overal design]We examined MM1.S myeloma cells exposed to 20 nM bortezomib across a time course with independent samples of poly(A) mRNA and ribosome footprints isolated at each of six time points (0h (untreated), 1.5h, 3h, 6h, 9h, 12h).

GSE59093	Homo sapiens	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	DDX3X regulation of global translation is impaired by medulloblastoma-associated mutations [RNA-Seq]	2014-07-03	Whole-genome sequencing recently identified recurrent missense mutations in the RNA helicase DDX3X in pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) and other tumors. The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59093	Scientific reports	4.011	https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25996	{Scientific reports (4.011): 10.1038/srep25996}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA254363	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA254363	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP044062	[Overal design]Examination of the whole tarnscriptome under conditions of DDX3X knockdown or overexpression of WT DDX3X or cancer-associated DDX3X mutants; [Treatment]'For knockdown experiments, HEK293T cells were treated with control or DDX3X siRNA oligos for 48 h.

We have carried our infections of human cells with Dengue and analyzed the translation, replication, and localization of the Dengue RNA. This allowed for clear definition of the life cycle of the Dengue virus inside a host cell. We also assessed the host response to Dengue virus, finding that a large fraction of the translational response is due to Interferon function.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69602	Journal of virology	4.324	https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01766-17	{Journal of virology (4.324): 10.1128/JVI.01766-17}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA285961	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA285961	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP059187	[Overal design]Translational and transcriptional analysis of the cellular response to Dengue virus infection; [Treatment]'Infection with DENV or treatment with interferon'; [Growth]'Cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS, 37C, 5% CO2'; [Extraction]'Pre-treatment with 180 uM cycloheximide for 30s.

GSE151877	Homo sapiens	44	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301; GPL24676	Parallel spatial transcriptomics, single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq analysis of the human embryonic HSC niche, the dorsal aorta	2020-06-05	Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Studies on model organisms defined intersecting signalling pathways that converge to promote HSC emergence predominantly in the ventral domain of the dorsal aorta. Much less is known about mechanisms driving HSC development in human. Here, to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development, we combined spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorso-ventral polarised signalling in the aorta with gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells. Our analysis revealed a subset of aortic endothelial cells with downregulated arterial signature and a predicted lineage relationship with the emerging HSC/ progenitor population. Analysis of the ventrally polarised molecular landscape identified endothelin 1 as an important secreted regulator of human HSC development. The obtained gene expression datasets will inform future studies on mechanisms of HSC development in vivo and on the generation of clinically relevant HSCs in vitro.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151877	Cell stem cell	21.464	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.08.004	{Cell stem cell (21.464): 10.1016/j.stem.2020.08.004}	'total RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA637571	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA637571	None	"[Overal design]Two LCM-Seq transcriptome analyses of spatially defined regions around the dorsal aorta (Carnegie Stages (CS) 16-17, N=6); RNA-Seq analysis of hematoendothelial populations from the dorsal and ventral portions of the dorsal aorta (AoV, AoD respectively) (CS15-16, N=2); single cell RNA-Seq analysis of the AoV (N=1) and central portion of the dorsal aorta (N=1).; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'The dorsal aortae were dissected from human embryos CS15-16 (N=2) then further bisected into ventral and dorsal portions (AoV and AoD respectively).

GSE102720	Homo sapiens	6	Other	GPL20301	Ternary protein•drug•RNA interface explains RocA sequence selectivity and Aglaia resistance	2017-08-16	A novel class of translation inhibitors isolated from Aglaia plants, exemplified by Rocaglamide A (RocA), shows promise as an anti-cancer therapy. RocA converts its molecular target, translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a DEAD-box protein, into a purine-selective RNA-binding protein that represses protein synthesis from a subset of mRNAs. This unusual mechanism of action raises the question of how the drug induces selectivity for polypurine sequences. Furthermore, as eIF4A is found in all eukaryotes, it is unclear how Aglaia resists the effects of RocA. Here, we assembled the Aglaia transcriptome de novo and identified highly specific mutations in eIF4A that enable it to evade RocA-dependent translation inhibition. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1•ATP analog•RocA•polypurine RNA complex. RocA binds residues mutated in Aglaia and intercalates between consecutive purines at a sharp RNA bend, revealing the structural basis of polypurine-selective translational inhibition by RocA in human and resistance in Aglaia.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102720	Molecular cell	14.548	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.026	{Molecular cell (14.548): 10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.026}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA398585	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA398585	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP115648	[Overal design]Ribosome,profiling; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification\nRibosome profiling'; [Cell type]'Source: ''treatment: control DMSO treatment; cell line: HEK293T-REx; extracted molecule: total RNA; extract_protocol: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction; ', 'treatment: RocA treatment; cell line: HEK293T-REx; extracted molecule: total RNA; extract_protocol: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction; '

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71892	Molecular cancer therapeutics	4.856	https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414	{Molecular cancer therapeutics (4.856): 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414}	'protein'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292424	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA292424	None	[Overal design]Secreted protein profiles of MCF7 and HCT116 Akti-1/2 treated cells and MCF7 and HCT116 vehicle (i.e. DMSO) treated cells were generated using antibody arrays.; [Treatment]'MCF7 and HCT116 cells were treated either with DMSO or Akti-1/2 for 6 days and culture supernatant were collected and frozen at -80°C until analysis.'; [Growth]'MCF7 was maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 40mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin; HCT116 was maintained in McCoy’s 5α medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100µg/mL streptomycin.

GSE125086	Homo sapiens	12	Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Ribosome queuing enables non-AUG translation to be resistant to multiple protein synthesis inhibitors	2019-01-15	Aberrant translation initiation at non-AUG start codons is associated with multiple cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, how non-AUG translation is regulated differently from canonical translation is poorly understood. We thus used start codon-selective reporters and ribosome profiling to characterize how translation from non-AUG start codons responds to protein synthesis inhibitors in human cells. These analyses surprisingly revealed that translation of non-AUG reporters and the endogenous GUG-encoded DAP5 (eIF4G2/p97) mRNA are resistant to cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inhibitor which slows but does not completely abrogate elongation. Our data suggest that slowly elongating ribosomes cause queuing of scanning pre-initiation complexes (PIC), preferentially enhancing otherwise poor recognition of non-AUG start codons. Consistent with this model, limiting PIC formation or scanning sensitizes non-AUG translation to CHX. Moreover, PIC queuing can cause translation from an AUG codon in a poor context to become less sensitive to CHX. We further find that non-AUG translation is resistant to other inhibitors that target ribosomes within the coding sequence, but not those targeting newly initiated ribosomes. In total, these data indicate that ribosome queuing enables mRNAs with poor initiation context, namely those from non-AUG start codons, to be resistant to pharmacological inhibitors.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE125086	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA515197	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA515197	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP179458	[Overal design]Measuring translational efficiency genome-wide in response to prolonged cyclohexamide treatment; [Treatment]'HeLa cells were seeded in duplicate for each time point in 10 cm plates with 10 mL media.

We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in TLR2-stimulated macrophages revealed that IFN-g selectively modulates the macrophage translatome to promote inflammation, further reprogram metabolic pathways, and modulate protein synthesis. These results add IFN-g-mediated metabolic reprogramming and translational regulation as key components of classical inflammatory macrophage activation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66809	Nature immunology	23.53	https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.3205	{Nature immunology (23.530): 10.1038/ni.3205}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA278009	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA278009	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP056098	[Overal design]RPF and RNAseq libraries were generated from mock or IFN-g-primed human macrophages.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.

GSE68706	Histoplasma capsulatum	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20173	Genome-wide reprogramming of transcript architecture by temperature specifies the developmental states of the human pathogen Histoplasma [transcriptional profiling]	2015-05-08	Eukaryotic cells integrate layers of gene regulation to coordinate complex cellular processes; however, mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation remain poorly studied. The human fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) responds to environmental or host temperature by initiating unique transcriptional programs to specify multicellular (hyphae) or unicellular (yeast) developmental states that function in infectivity or pathogenesis, respectively. Here we used recent advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation in Hc developmental cell types. We found that ~2% percent of Hc transcripts exhibit 5’ leader sequences that differ markedly in length between morphogenetic states. Ribosome density and mRNA abundance measurements uncovered a class of differential leader transcripts that exhibit tight transcriptional and translational regulation. Further examination of these dually regulated genes revealed that some control Hc morphology and that their strict regulation is necessary for the pathogen to make appropriate developmental decisions in response to temperature. This series contains expression profiling data for four strains of Hc.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68706	PLoS genetics	5.224	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005395	{PLoS genetics (5.224): 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005395}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA283426	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA283426	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP058149	[Overal design]Expression profiling by paired-end RNA sequencing was performed for two biological replicates for each of four strains of Histoplasma capsulatum (G217B, G186AR, H88, and H143) from cells grown in the yeast or hyphal phase (16 samples total).; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'G217B, G186AR, H88, and H143 yeast cells were inoculated from HMM agarose plates into HMM liquid medium for yeast-phase growth.

The mechanisms by which environmental toxicants alter developmental processes predisposing individuals to chronic disease are not understood. arsenic exposure via drinking water causes cancer and cardiovascular disease. Transplacental arsenic exposure accelerates and exacerbates atherosclerosis in ApoE-knockout mice. The liver plays a central role in the interlinked diseases diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. The hypothesis that accelerated atherosclerosis is a consequence of altered hepatic development was investigated by microarray profiling of mRNA and microRNA abundance in livers isolated from 10 week old (PND70) and newborn (PND1) mice exposed or not exposed to arsenic from day 8 post-fertilization to birth. The results show that arsenic exposure alters the trajectory of both mRNA and microRNA expression as mice age. A 51-gene signature of arsenic exposure in both PND1 and PND70 mice was identified. Pathway Architect analysis of this signature identified nodes of interaction including Hspa8, IgM and Hnf4a. Gene ontology analysis of arsenic exposure-altered mRNAs indicated that pathways for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were suppressed in PND1 mice and pathways for protein export, ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, and complement and coagulation cascades were induced in PND70 mice. Analysis of promoters of differentially expressed genes identified enriched transcription factor binding sites and cluster analyses revealed groups of genes sharing sets of transcription factor binding sites suggesting common regulation. Srebp1 binding sites are present in ~1/6 of the genes differentially expressed in PND70 livers. Western blot analyses of PND70 liver proteins showed that the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hspa1, Hsp70) and the active form of Srebp1 were induced in arsenic-exposed mice as were plasma AST and ALT levels.

GSE56148	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	A novel IRES identified in DMD results in a functional N-truncated dystrophin, providing a potential route to therapy for patients with 5’ mutations.	2014-03-24	Purpose: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were used to map the location and abundance of translating ribosomes on human skeletal muscle transcripts from a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy. Methods: Tissue homogenates were prepared from frozen sections of a muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control. Ribosome-protected fragments and total RNA were prepared from a single homogenate, so starting RNA populations for both libraries were closely matched. Homogenates were not clarified before RNase digestion to avoid loss of ribosomes associated with large molecular weight complexes and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared after rRNA subtraction to avoid positional loss of 5’ reads. RPF-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and RNA-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit (Illumina). RPF-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries were subjected to 50 cycles of single-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Trimmed and filtered RPF- and RNA-Seq reads were mapped to RefSeq fasta sequences downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (hg19 assembly). Results: Most mutations that truncate the reading frame of the DMD gene result in loss of dystrophin expression and lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, amelioration of disease severity can result from alternate translation initiation beginning in DMD exon 6 that results in the expression of a highly functional N-truncated dystrophin. This novel isoform results from usage of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within exon 5 that is glucocorticoid-inducible. IRES activity is confirmed in patient muscle by both peptide sequencing and ribosomal profiling. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular explanation for the rescue of 5’ truncating mutations via a heretofore undescribed mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of dystrophin expression. The presence of a glucocorticoid-inducible IRES within a highly conserved region of the DMD sequence strongly suggests a programmed role for alternate translation initiation, and ongoing efforts to understand the relevant cell lineage-specific and/or conditional activation signals will shed light on underlying mechanisms of IRES control and elucidate potentially novel functions of dystrophin.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56148	Nature medicine	30.641	https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3628	{Nature medicine (30.641): 10.1038/nm.3628}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA242628	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA242628	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP040550	[Overal design]Skeletal muscle ribosome-protected fragment and RNA-Seq profiles from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control were generated by deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Tissue homogenates were prepared from 40 frozen ten-micron sections of muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA mutation and a normal control.'; [Extraction]'Sections were lysed by 20 passages through a 26 gauge needle after addition of 500 μl of ice-cold 20 mM Tris*Cl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100 and 100 μg / ml cycloheximide (Sigma).

Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49339	Nature	43.07	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12730	{Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics (None) doi:10.1016/j.gpb.2012.12.002}; {Nature (43.070) doi:10.1038/nature12730}; 	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA213675	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA213675	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP028325	[Overal design]PAR-CLIP and RIP was used to identify YTHDF2 binding sites followed by ribosome profling and RNA seq to assess the consequences of YTHDF2 siRNA knock-down; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'fed with 4SU, UV crosslink, partial digested by RNase T1, anti-flag-beads IP, recovered by trizol\nTruseq small RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'anti-flag-beads IP, recovered by trizol\nTruseq stranded mRNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extract by trizol, then poly-dT beads pull-down\nTruseq stranded mRNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extract by trizol, then rRNA removal\nTruseq stranded mRNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Isolate from surcrose gradient, recovered by trizol\nTruseq small RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extract by trizol, poly-dT beads pull-down\nTruseq small RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extracy by trizol, then rRNA removal\nTruseq small RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extract total RNA by Rneasy kit (QIAGEN), Dnase I treated, then add ERCC RNA spike-in control\nTruseq small RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extract total RNA by Rneasy kit (QIAGEN), Dnase I treated, then add ERCC RNA spike-in control\nTruseq RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Extract total RNA by Rneasy kit (QIAGEN), Dnase I treated, then add ERCC RNA spike-in control\nTruseq stranded mRNA sample prepration kit (illumina)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: HeLa; treatment: over-express N-terminal flag-tagged YTHDF2 for 24h (0.75ug plasmid/mL); ', 'cell line: HeLa; treatment: over-express N-terminal flag-tagged YTHDF2 for 24h(0.75ug plasmid/mL); ', 'cell line: HeLa; treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; ', 'cell line: HeLa; treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h, then add actinomycin for 0h; ', 'cell line: HeLa; treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h, then add actinomycin for 3h; ', 'cell line: HeLa; treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h, then add actinomycin for 6h; '

Using these profiles we generated molecular signatures for each of these cell types, proved that the molecular identity of these cell types is very well conserved across mouse and humans, and constructed functional networks for each cell type that allowed us to identify genes and pathways associated with selective neuronal vulnerability in AD. We also report the profiling of ECII neurons in APP/PS1 mice (a mouse model of Abeta accumulation) at 6 months of age.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151460	Neuron	14.403	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.06.010	{Neuron (14.403): 10.1016/j.neuron.2020.06.010}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA635898	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA635898	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP265281	[Overal design]We constructed bacTRAP mice overexpressing eGFP-L10a in a cell-type specific manner. Cell-type specific expression was achieved using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) that contain the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes. For ECII neurons, we used four different lines: two Rasgrp2-bacTRAP lines (using BACs RP23-199D5 and RP24-344N1), two different founder lines for Sh3bgrl2 (using BAC RP23-307B16); for CA1 neurons, two different lines: one SSTR4-bacTRAP (BAC RP23-126C5), and one Cck-bacTRAP line generated previously by the Heintz lab; for CA2 neurons: one Cacng5-bacTRAP line (BAC RP23- 329L1); for CA3 neurons: one Gprin3-bacTRAP line generated previously by the Heintz lab; for dentate gyrus granule neurons: one SSTR4-bacTRAP line (using BAC RP23-126C5, another founder from the one used for CA1, with ectopic expression in DG granule neurons); for V1: one Calca-bacTRAP line (BAC RP23-181A2); for S1: one Cartpt-bacTRAP line (BAC RP24-68J22). We used these mice to immunoprecipitate polysomes from these neurons at 4-5, 12 and 24 months of age, and profiled the isolated mRNA using RNAseq. Additionally, we profiled APP/PS1 mice crossed to ECII-bacTRAP mice (one of the Sh3bgrl2-bacTRAP lines) at 6 months of age to study the effects of Amyloid accumulation on ECII gene expression. In the end we had 3 to 12 replicates for each neuron type at each age. Each replicate consisted in the pooling of 2 different mice. Male mice were used for the profiling in wild-type mice.

GSE111222	Homo sapiens	7	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	A Multi-Parameter Analysis of Cellular Coordination of Major Transcriptome Regulation Mechanisms	2018-02-27	To understand cellular coordination of multiple transcriptome regulation mechanisms, we simultaneously measured transcription rate (TR), mRNA abundance (RA) and translation activity (TA). This revealed multiple quantitative insights. First, the genomic profiles of the three parameters are systematically different in key statistical features. Sequentially more genes exhibit extreme low or high expression values from TR to RA, then to TA. That is, because of cellular coordination of these regulatory mechanisms, sequentially higher levels of gene expression selectivity are achieved as genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, the contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between the estimated mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of a mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibits a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and is thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely follow this regulation. In summary, we quantitatively delineated the relationship among multiple transcriptome regulation parameters, i.e., cellular coordination of corresponding regulatory mechanisms.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111222	Scientific reports	4.011	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24039-1	{Scientific reports (4.011): 10.1038/s41598-018-24039-1}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA436186	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA436186	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP133625	[Overal design]Simultaneous measurement of transcription rate with GRO-seq, mRNA abundance with RNA-seq and mRNA translation activity with polysome profiling; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: HCT116; '

These viruses utilize an 11kb RNA genome for translation and replication, and much remains to be learnt about how the entire genome folds to enable virus function. Here, we performed high throughput RNA secondary structure and pair-wise interaction mapping on four dengue serotypes and four Zika strains within their virus particles. We identified structures that are associated with translation pausing, and are evolutionary conserved by integrating synonymous mutation rates into our analysis. Genome-wide interaction mapping revealed alternative structures, as well as extensive long-range RNA interactions – including the known circularization signals– within the virus particles. Many of these long-range interactions are conserved across the viruses and/or clustered into “hubs” that are shown to be functionally important. This comprehensive structural resource of dengue and Zika viruses reveals that viral genome organization is much more complex than previously appreciated and deepens our understanding of the molecular basis for viral pathogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106483	Nature communications	11.878	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09391-8	{Nature communications (11.878): 10.1038/s41467-019-09391-8}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA417011	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA417011	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP123568	[Overal design]Local RNA structure probing and long-range RNA interactome mapping in 4 dengue serotypes and 4 Zika strains; [Treatment]'Fresh virus particles are treated with NAI for secondary structure mapping, and with biotinylated psoralen for interactome mapping, at 37C for 10 min.

GSE138642	Homo sapiens	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Stop Codon Context Influences Genome-Wide Stimulation of Termination Codon Readthrough by Aminoglycosides [Dataset 5]	2019-10-09	Stop codon readthrough (SCR) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138642	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576653	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576653	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224956	[Overal design]2 ribosome profiling and 4 RNA-seq samples are included from Calu-6 cells; [Treatment]'Aminoglycosides were added to cells, and treated for 24 hours'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS to ~75% confluency before harvest'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed on ice in the presence of cycloheximide.

GSE130595	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Effect of ILF3 depletion in HeLa cells on RNA steady state levels	2019-05-01	Upon detection of viral infections, cells activate the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines to control viral dissemination. As part of their antiviral response, cells also trigger the translational shutoff response which prevents translation of viral mRNAs and cellular mRNAs in a non-selective manner. Intriguingly, mRNAs encoding for antiviral factors bypass this translational shutoff, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms enabling expression of the self-defence genes. Here, we identified the dsRNA binding protein ILF3 as an essential host factor required for efficient translation of the central antiviral cytokine, IFNB1, and a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. By combining polysome profiling and next-generation sequencing, ILF3 was also found to be necessary to establish the dsRNA-induced transcriptional and translational programs. We propose a central role for the host factor ILF3 in enhancing expression of the antiviral defence mRNAs in cellular conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130595	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1060	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkz1060}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA540710	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA540710	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP194425	[Overal design]HeLa cells were depleted of ILF3 using a pool of siRNAs that target ILF3 (siILF3) and a pool of non targeting siRNAs as a control (Mock) for 72 hours. the cells were then transfected with or without poly(I:C) for 4 hours and harvested using Trizol.

GSE97384	Homo sapiens	18	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL11154	mTORC1 balances cellular amino acid supply with demand for protein synthesis through post-transcriptional control of ATF4	2017-04-04	The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cell growth that is commonly deregulated in human diseases. Here we find that mTORC1 controls a transcriptional program encoding amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes through a mechanism also used to regulate protein synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of mTORC1-responsive mRNAs identified a promoter element recognized by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key effector of the integrated stress response. ATF4 translation is normally induced by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) through a mechanism that requires upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the ATF4 5' UTR. mTORC1 also controls ATF4 translation through uORFs, but independent of changes in eIF2α phosphorylation. mTORC1 instead employs the 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) family of translation repressors. These results link mTORC1-regulated demand for protein synthesis with an ATF4-regulated transcriptional program that controls the supply of amino acids to the translation machinery.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97384	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.042	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.042}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA381596	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA381596	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP103009	[Overal design]RNA-seq analysis of wild-type and ATF4-null HEK293T cells treated with Torin 1 or tunicamycin for 6 h, and ribosome profiling analysis of HEK293T cells treated with Torin 1 for 24 h.; [Treatment]'Cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 250 nM Torin 1, or 1 µM tunicamycin, as indicated.'; [Growth]'Cells were grown in DMEM + 10% heat-inactivated FBS.'; [Extraction]'Trizol, SDS/Proteinase K\nClontech SMARTer RNA-seq or adapter ligation.

GSE67902	Homo sapiens	12	Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Regulation of protein translation during mitosis	2015-04-15	Entry into and exit from mitosis is driven by precisely-timed changes in protein abundance, and involves transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. However, the role of translational regulation in modulating cellular protein content during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we show that translational, rather than transcriptional regulation is the dominant mechanism for modulating protein synthesis at mitotic entry. The vast majority of regulated mRNAs are translationally repressed, which contrasts previous findings of selective mRNA translational activation at mitotic entry. One of the most pronounced translationally repressed genes in mitosis is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), which is degraded during mitosis. We show that Emi1 degradation is insufficient for full APC activation and that simultaneous translational repression is required. These results provide a genome-wide view of protein translation during mitosis and suggest that translational repression may be used to ensure complete protein inactivation	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67902	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07957	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.07957}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA281177	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA281177	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP057253	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq from 3 time points in the cell cycle; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Cells were lysed with 0.5% triton, the lysate was cleard by centirifugation, treated with RNaseI for 45min and then loaded on a sucrose cushion.

In response to oncogenic RAS signaling, the initiation pausing relaxes and contributes to the increased translational flux. Intriguingly, mRNA m6A modification in the vicinity of start codons influences the behavior of initiating ribosomes. Under oncogenic RAS signaling, the reduced mRNA methylation leads to relaxed initiation pausing, thereby promoting malignant transformation and tumor growth. Restored initiation pausing by inhibiting m6A demethylases suppresses RAS-mediated oncogenic translation and subsequent tumorigenesis. Our findings unveil a new paradigm of translational control that is co-opted by RAS mutant cancer cells to drive malignant phenotypes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159210	Science advances	12.804	https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd6927	{Science advances (12.804): 10.1126/sciadv.abd6927}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA667952	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA667952	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP286677	[Overal design]We took advantage of a human TtH cell line stably expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible ER:HRASG12V fusion protein.

GSE132725	Homo sapiens	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL21290	Transcriptome and ribosome profiling of XRN1-null HEK293T human cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing	2019-06-13	XRN1 is the major cytoplasmic exoribonuclease in eukaryotes, which degrades deadenylated and decapped mRNAs in the last step of the 5′–3′ mRNA decay pathway. Metazoan XRN1 interacts with decapping factors coupling the final stages of decay. Ribosome profiling revealed that XRN1 loss impacts not only on mRNA levels but also on the translational efficiency of many cellular transcripts likely as a consequence of incomplete decay. We compared differentially expressed genes derived from the analysis of the transcriptome and the translatome of HEK293T wild-type (WT) and XRN1-null cells by RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq, respectively. Two biological replicates of each cell line were analyzed. The RNA-Seq analysis indicated that a substantial fraction of the total 10,105 genes showed significant differences between the two cell lines. 2,906 genes were significantly upregulated whilst 2,900 genes were downregulated using a fold change >0 on log2 scale with an FDR<0.005 to determine abundance. Significantly fewer genes showed differences between the WT and the XRN1-null cells at the level of translation with 433 genes showing an increase in abundance of ribosomal footprints whilst 560 genes were decreased as indicated by the Ribo-Seq analysis. Comparative analysis of translational efficiency (TE) in WT and XRN1-null cells on a genome-wide scale as a ratio of ribosomal occupancy to mRNA abundance identified an increase in TE for 102 genes but a decrease for 598 genes with most of the genes showing no evidence of change in the TE.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132725	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz633	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkz633}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA548813	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA548813	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP201395	[Overal design]Two cell types with two biological replicates analysed using two methods.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'6.4x10^6 cells of HEK293T WT or XRN1-null cells were plated on 15 cm dishes 24 hrs before harvesting.'; [Extraction]'Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and a library prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina).

GSE84746	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	19	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL17143; GPL19958	Dual randomization of oligonucleotides to reduce the bias in ribosome-profiling libraries	2016-07-22	Protein translation is at the heart of cellular metabolism and its in-depth characterization is key for many lines of research. Recently, ribosome profiling became the state-of-the-art method to quantitatively characterize translation dynamics at a transcriptome-wide level. However, the strategy of library generation affects its outcomes. Here, we present a modified ribosomeprofiling protocol starting from yeast, human cells and vertebrate brain tissue. We use a DNA linker carrying four randomized positions at its 5’ and a reverse-transcription (RT) primer with three randomized positions to reduce artifacts during library preparation. The use of seven randomized nucleotides allows to efficiently detect library-generation artifacts. We find that the effect of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts is relatively small for global analyses when sufficient input material is used. However, when input material is limiting, our strategy improves the sensitivity of gene-specific analyses. Furthermore, randomized nucleotides alleviate the skewed frequency of specific sequences at the 3’ end of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) likely resulting from ligase specificity. Finally, strategies that rely on dual ligation show a high degree of gene-coverage variation. Taken together, our approach helps to remedy two of the main problems associated with ribosome-profiling data. This will facilitate the analysis of translational dynamics and increase our understanding of the influence of RNA modifications on translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84746	Methods (San Diego, Calif.)	3.782	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.07.011	{Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

GSE150439	Homo sapiens	4	Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Effect of QTRT2 KO  on mitochondrial translation	2020-05-12	Mitochondria are organelles that generate most of the energy in eukaryotic cells in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryote. Twenty-two species of mitochondrial (mt-)tRNAs encoded in mtDNA are required to translate essential subunits of the respiratory chain complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. mt-tRNAs contain post-transcriptional modifications introduced by nuclear-encoded tRNA-modifying enzymes. These modifications are required for deciphering genetic code accurately, as well as stabilizing tRNA. Loss of tRNA modifications frequently results in severe pathological consequences. We performed a comprehensive analysis of post-transcriptional modifications of all human mt-tRNAs, including 14 previously-uncharacterized species, and revised the modification status of some of the previously studied species. In total, we found 17 kinds of RNA modifications at 137 positions (8.7% in 1,575 nucleobases) in 22 species of human mt-tRNAs. An up-to-date list of 34 genes responsible for human mt-tRNA modifications are provided. We here demonstrated that both QTRT1 and QTRT2 are required for biogenesis of queuosine (Q) at position 34 of four mt-tRNAs. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial decoding system, and could help to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases caused by aberrant tRNA modifications.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE150439	Nature communications	11.878	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18068-6	{Nature communications (11.878): 10.1038/s41467-020-18068-6}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA632042	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA632042	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP261344	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNA extraction, RNaseI footprinting, ribosome pelletting, 17-34 nt gel excision, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification'; [Cell type]'Source: ''genetic background: WT; cell line: HEK293T; ', 'genetic background: QTRT2 KO; cell line: HEK293T; '
GSE133111	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Ribosome profiling of A549 cells depleted of RPLP1 and RPLP2 and infected with DENV.	2019-06-20	We used ribosome profiling to evaluate viral and cellular translation in RPLP1/2-depleted cells. This revealed that ribosomes pause in the sequence coding for the N-terminus of the envelope protein, immediately downstream of sequences encoding two adjacent transmembrane domains (TMDs). RPLP1/2 function to enhance ribosome elongation at this position and increase viral protein stability, possibly by improving co-translational folding of DENV proteins. We also analyzed the effects of RPLP1/2 depletion on cellular translation. We find that RPLP1/2 moderately affects ribosome density for a small subset of cellular mRNAs. However, meta-analysis of ribosome positions on all cellular mRNAs revealed slightly increased accumulation of ribosomes downstream of start codons in RPLP1/2-depleted cells, suggesting that RPLP1/2 enhance elongation efficiency. Importantly, we found that ribosome density on mRNAs encoding multiple TMDs was disproportionately affected by RPLP1/2 knockdown, suggesting a role for RPLP1/2 in transmembrane protein biogenesis. Together, our findings reveal insights into the function of RPLP1/2 in DENV and cellular translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133111	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA549955	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA549955	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP202033	"[Overal design]A549 cells were plated at 1.5 x 106 cells per 10 cm dish.

GSE140639	Homo sapiens	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL20301	Genome-wide survey of ribosome collision [anisomycin]	2019-11-19	In protein synthesis, ribosome movement is not always smooth, rather often impeded by numerous reasons. Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3′ UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140639	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107610	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107610}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA590355	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA590355	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP230602	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'RNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification for ribosome profiling'; [Cell type]'Source: ''treatment: anisomycin; genetic background: WT; cell line: HEK293; extracted molecule: total RNA; extract_protocol: Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction; '
GSE49310	Candida albicans	96	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL15645	The Transcriptional Stress Response of Candida albicans to Weak Organic Acids	2013-07-29	Candida albicans is the most important fungal pathogen of humans, causing severe infections especially in nosocomial and immunocompromised settings. However, it is also the most prevalent fungus of the normal human microbiome, where it shares its habitat with hundreds of trillions of other microbial cells. Despite weak organic acids (WOAs) being among the most abundant metabolites produced by bacterial microbiota, little is known about their effect on C. albicans. Here we employed a sequencing-based profiling strategy to systematically investigate the transcriptional stress response of C. albicans to lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid at several time points after treatment. Our data reveal a complex transcriptional response, with individual WOAs triggering unique gene expression profiles and with important differences between acute and chronic exposure. In spite of all these dissimilarities, we found significant overlaps between the gene expression changes induced by each WOA, which lead us to uncover a core transcriptional signature that was unrelated to the general response to low pH. Genes commonly up-regulated by WOAs were enriched in several iron transporters, which was associated with an overall decrease in intracellular iron concentrations. Moreover, chronic exposure to any WOA lead to down-regulation of RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis genes, which resulted in significant reduction of total RNA levels in general and of ribosomal RNA in particular. In conclusion, this study suggests that GI microbiota might directly influence C. albicans physiology via production of WOAs, with possible implications of how this fungus interacts with its hosts in both health and disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49310	G3 (Bethesda, Md.)	2.63	https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.114.015941	{G3 (Bethesda, Md.)

Although 4E-BP has been shown to be important in growth control, stress response, cancer, neuronal activity and mammalian circadian rhythms, it is not understood how it preferentially represses a subset of mRNAs. We successfully used hyperTRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to identify in vivo 4E-BP mRNA targets in both Drosophila and mammals under conditions known to activate 4E-BP. The protein associates with specific mRNAs, and ribosome profiling data show that mTOR inhibition changes the translational efficiency of 4E-BP TRIBE targets compared to non-targets. In both systems, these targets have specific motifs and are enriched in translation-related pathways, which correlate well with the known activity of 4E-BP and suggest that it modulates the binding specificity of eIF4E and contributes to mTOR translational specificity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153346	Science advances	12.804	https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb8771	{Science advances (12.804): 10.1126/sciadv.abb8771}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA642123	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA642123	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP269009	[Overal design]We used hyperTRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to identify in vivo 4E-BP mRNA targets in both Drosophila S2 cells and human prostate cancer cell PC3 under conditions known to activate 4E-BP.

We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE. ZNF658 was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a band excised after EMSA using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. siRNA targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5), SLC30A10 (ZnT10) and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered large changes in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59385	Molecular and cellular biology	3.735	https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.01298-14	{Molecular and cellular biology (3.735): 10.1128/MCB.01298-14}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA255227	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA255227	None	[Overal design]Gene expression profiling by Illumina BeadArray of the effects of ZNF658 gene knockdown by siRNA. 2 different siRNAs were used, with appropriate non-targetting controls.

GSE123539	Homo sapiens	18	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL20301	Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation	2018-12-10	UFM1 is a small, metazoan-specific, ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is essential for embryonic development. Although loss-of-function mutations in UFM1 conjugation are linked to ER stress, neither the biological function nor the relevant cellular targets of this protein modifier are known. Here we show that a largely uncharacterized ribosomal protein, RPL26, is the principal target of UFM1 conjugation. RPL26 UFMylation and deUFMylation is catalyzed by enzyme complexes tethered to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER and UFMylated RPL26 is highly enriched on ER membrane-bound ribosomes and polysomes. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling establish that UFMylated RPL26 and the UFMylation machinery are in close proximity to the SEC61 translocon, suggesting that this modification plays a direct role in cotranslational protein translocation into the ER. These data suggest that UFMylation is a ribosomal modification specialized to facilitate metazoan-specific protein biogenesis at the ER.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123539	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	9.58	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1816202116	{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (9.580): 10.1073/pnas.1816202116}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA509149	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA509149	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP173217	"[Overal design]ribosome profiling of membrane and cytosolic fractions of UFM1-KO, UFSP2-KO, and wild-type HEK cells in duplicate (12 samples); mRNA-seq of whole cell lysates of UFM1-KO, UFSP2-KO, and wild-type HEK cells in duplicate (6 samples); [Treatment]'Cas9 knockout with sgUFM1', 'Cas9 knockout with sgUFSP2', 'None'; [Growth]""Cells cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS at 37'C and 5% CO2""; [Extraction]'Triton-X lysis of leftover pellet from cytosolic fractionation followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris\nRNase I footprinting, ultracentrifugation, denaturing RNA extraction, dephosphorylation, preadenylated inker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification', 'Detergent lysis with digitonin, centrifugation to remove cell debris and organelles\nRNase I footprinting, ultracentrifugation, denaturing RNA extraction, dephosphorylation, preadenylated inker ligation, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification', 'Detergent lysis with Triton-X followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris\nDenaturing RNA extraction, TruSeq stranded RNA-Seq library generation with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: Clonal UFM1-KO HEK293 cells generated with Cas9; fraction: membrane; ', 'cell line: Clonal UFM1-KO HEK293 cells generated with Cas9; fraction: cytosolic; ', 'cell line: Clonal UFSP2-KO HEK293 cells generated with Cas9; fraction: membrane; ', 'cell line: Clonal UFSP2-KO HEK293 cells generated with Cas9; fraction: cytosolic; ', 'cell line: HEK 293; fraction: membrane; ', 'cell line: HEK 293; fraction: cytosolic; ', 'cell line: Clonal UFM1-KO HEK293 cells generated with Cas9; fraction: whole cell lysate; ', 'cell line: Clonal UFSP2-KO HEK293 cells generated with Cas9; fraction: whole cell lysate; ', 'cell line: HEK 293; fraction: whole cell lysate; '"

The regulatory processes that shape the platelet transcriptome and the full scope of platelet translation have remained elusive. Using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling of primary human platelets, we show the platelet transcriptome encompasses a subset of transcripts detected by RNA-Seq analysis of in vitro derived MK cells and these platelet-enriched transcripts are broadly occupied by ribosomes. We use RNA sequencing of synchronized populations of in vitro derived platelet-like particles (PLPs) to show that mRNA decay strongly shapes the nascent platelet transcriptome. Our data suggests that the decay of platelet mRNAs is slowed by the natural loss of the mRNA surveillance and ribosome rescue factor Pelota (PELO).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94384	Blood	16.562	https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2016-08-736108	{Blood (16.562): 10.1182/blood-2016-08-736108}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA369543	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA369543	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP098699	[Overal design]Analysis of RNA sequencing data from primary human platelets and in vitro derived platelet-like particles; manipulation by overexpression of Pelota (PELO) in Meg01/platelet-like particles.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'Cells were grown as described in Mills EW et al., 2017'; [Extraction]'Samples were extracted as described previously in Ingolia et al., 2014\nRNA-Seq libraries were prepared as described previously in Ingolia et al., 2014 using the TruSeq stranded RNA-Seq protocol'; [Cell type]'Source: ''tissue: primary cell type; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; ', 'tissue: cell line; drug treatment: 0.05ng Promega Firefly luciferase per 100ng Total RNA; rrna depletion: RiboZero-Gold rRNA depletion; '
GSE70270	Homo sapiens	32	Expression profiling by array; Other	GPL18190	Assessment of mTOR-Dependent Translational Regulation of Interferon Stimulated Genes	2015-06-25	Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been implicated in translational control of mRNAs encoding interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, mTOR-sensitive translatomes commonly include mRNAs with a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, but not ISGs. Because these translatomes were obtained under conditions when ISG expression is not induced, we examined the mTOR-sensitive translatome in human WISH cells stimulated with IFNβ. The mTOR inhibitor Torin1 resulted in a repression of global protein synthesis, including that of ISG products, and translation of all but 3 ISG mRNAs (TLR3, NT5C3A, and RNF19B) was not selectively more sensitive to mTOR inhibition. Detailed studies of NT5C3A revealed an IFN-induced change in transcription start site resulting in a switch from a non-TOP to a TOP-like transcript variant and mTOR sensitive translation. Thus, we show that, in the cell model used, translation of the vast majority of ISG mRNAs is not selectively sensitive to mTOR activity and describe an uncharacterized mechanism wherein the 5’-UTR of an mRNA is altered in response to a cytokine, resulting in a shift from mTOR-insensitive to mTOR-sensitive translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70270	PloS one	2.776	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133482	{PloS one (2.776): 10.1371/journal.pone.0133482}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA288136	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA288136	None	[Overal design]WISH cells were induced with interferon in the presence of vehicle, torin-1 or rapamycin.

GSE14335	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by array	GPL571	Whole genome profiling of fibroblasts from Diamond-Blackfan Anemia patients	2009-01-08	Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited red cell hypoplasia characterized by a defect in the maturation of erythroid progenitors and is in some cases associated to malformations. Patients have an increased risk of solid tumors. Mutations have been found in several ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Studies in hematopoietic progenitors from patients show that the haploinsufficiency of an RP impairs rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. DBA lymphocytes and fibroblasts show reduced protein synthesis, and the latter display abnormal rRNA processing and impaired proliferation. To evaluate the involvement of non-hematopoietic tissues in DBA, we have analyzed global gene expression in fibroblasts from DBA patients compared to healthy controls. Microarray expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays revealed that 421 genes are statistically significantly differentially expressed in DBA patients' fibroblasts relative to controls. These genes include a large cluster of ribosomal proteins and factors involved in protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes with roles in cell death, cancer and tissue development. Our results report for the first time into abnormal expression in a non-hematopoietic cell type in DBA, and support the hypothesis that DBA may be due to a defect in general or specific protein synthesis.

GSE68435	Schizosaccharomyces pombe	12	Expression profiling by array	GPL2529	Yeast m6A methylated mRNAs are enriched on translating ribosomes during meiosis, and under Rapamycin treatment	2015-04-30	Interest in mRNA methylation has exploded in recent years. The sudden interest in a 40 year old discovery was due in part to the recent finding of FTO?s (Fat Mass Obesity) N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) deaminase activity, thus suggested a link between obesity-associated diseases and the presence of m6A in mRNA. Another catalyst of the sudden rise in mRNA methylation research was the release of mRNA methylomes for human, mouse and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the molecular function, or functions of this mRNA ?epimark? remain to be discovered. There is supportive evidence that m6A could be a mark for mRNA degradation due to its binding to YTH domain proteins, and consequently being chaperoned to P bodies. Nonetheless, only a subpopulation of the methylome was found binding to YTHDF2 in HeLa cells. The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has only one YTH domain protein (Pho92, Mrb1), which targets PHO4 transcripts for degradation under phosphate starvation. However, mRNA methylation is only found under meiosis inducing conditions, and PHO4 transcripts are apparently non-methylated. In this paper we set out to investigate if m6A could function alternatively to being a degradation mark in S. cerevisiae, we also sought to test whether it can be induced under non-standard sporulation conditions. We find associations between the presence of m6A and message translatability. We also find m6A induction following prolonged rapamycin treatment.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68435	PloS one	2.776	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132090	{PloS one (2.776): 10.1371/journal.pone.0132090}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA282733	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA282733	None	[Overal design]GeneChip analyses were performed to investigate the distribution of early meiotic transcripts (3hours) on different polysome and monosome fractions; [Treatment]'Polysome profiles The ribosomal complexes in the yeast cultures were stabilized by adding cycloheximide to a 100µg/ml final concentration prior to harvest.

Platforms using the whole adult organism to evaluate the genome-wide response to toxicants are especially attractive. Recent work demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in vertebrates using the experimentally robust zebrafish model. In the present study, we evaluated gene expression changes in whole adult zebrafish following an acute 24 hour exposure to three metals with known human health risks. Male adult zebrafish were exposed to nickel chloride, cobalt chloride, and sodium dichromate concentrations corresponding to their respective 96 hr LC20, LC40 and LC60. Histopathology was performed on a subset of metal-exposed zebrafish to phenotypically anchor transcriptional changes associated with each metal. Comparative analysis identified subsets of differentially expressed transcripts both overlapping and unique to each metal. Application of gene ontology (GO) and transcription factor enrichment algorithms revealed a number of key biological processes perturbed by metal exposures and the master transcriptional regulators mediating gene expression changes. Metal exposures differentially activated biological processes associated with ribosome biogenesis, proteosomal degradation and p53 signaling cascades, while repressing oxygen-generating pathways associated with amino acid and lipid metabolism. Despite appreciable effects on gene regulation, nickel exposures did not induce any morphological alterations in zebrafish organs and tissues. Histopathological effects of cobalt remained confined to the olfactory system, while chromium targeted the gills, pharynx and intestinal mucosa. A number of enriched transcription factors mediate the observed gene response to metal exposure, including known targets such as p53, HIF1 and the myc oncogene and novel regulatory factors such as XBP1, GATA6 and HNF3. This work uses an experimentally innovative approach to capture global responses to metal exposures and provides mechanistic insights into metal toxicity mechanisms.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50648	BMC pharmacology & toxicology	2.103	https://doi.org/10.1186/2050-6511-15-15	{Genomics data (None) doi:10.1016/j.gdata.2014.10.013}; {BMC pharmacology & toxicology (2.103) doi:10.1186/2050-6511-15-15}; 	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA218201	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA218201	None	[Overal design]Metal induced changes in gene expression in zebrafish were measured after 24 h exposures to each of three metals (nickel, chromium or cobalt).

Immediately after depolarisation, genes with known function at the synapse were subjected to a surge of translational activity without corresponding changes in mRNA levels. At later time-points, however, these changes became synchronised, suggesting there are different layers of post-transcriptional regulation which are temporally separated but become coordinated over time. Sequencing of small RNAs additionally revealed that changes in microRNA (miRNA) and tRNA-derived small RNA fragments (tRFs) coincided with this early post-transcriptional disparity, however these molecules exhibited strongest association with the remodelling of mRNA steady-state levels. Transcripts displaying high levels of translational dynamics relative to underlying mRNA levels were characterised by more intrinsic features, including mRNA length, GC content, secondary structure and motifs for RNA binding proteins. These data suggest that activity-associated neuronal translation is initially regulated independently of mRNA levels, wherein transcript features contribute to modulation of mRNA translatability, while miRNA and tRFs fine-tune mRNA levels.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155727	International journal of molecular sciences	4.183	https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21197086	{International journal of molecular sciences (4.183): 10.3390/ijms21197086}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA655417	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA655417	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP276055	"[Overal design]Examination of changes in mRNA translation, expression and small RNA expression in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.; [Treatment]""Depolarised cells were incubated in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (35mM NaCl, 0.6mM MgSO4.7H2O, 2.5 mM CaCl2.2H2O, 10mM HEPES, 6mM Glucose) supplemented with stimulating concentrations of KCl (100mM).

There are several variants of the ribosome profiling technique that use different translation inhibitors. The regular ribo-seq utilizes Cycloheximide (CHX), a translation elongation inhibitor to freeze all translating ribosomes. In contrast to CHX, the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM) and harringtonine (Harr) have a much stronger effect on initiating ribosomes. The use of these inhibitors allows for the global mapping of translating initiating sites (TISs) when they are coupled with ribosome profiling (TI-seq). We have developed a computational tool to detect and/or quantitatively compare translation initiation from TI-seq data, and predict novel ORFs from regular CHX-based ribo-seq data.

While the highly abundant N6-methyladonsine (m6A) modification affects most aspects of mRNA function, the precise functions of the rarer 5-methylcytosine (m5C) remains largely unknown. Here, we map m5C in the human transcriptome using methylation-dependent individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) combined with RNA bisulfite sequencing. We identify NSUN6 as a methyltransferase with strong substrate specificity towards mRNA. NSUN6 primarily targeted three prime untranslated regions (3’UTR) at the consensus sequence motif CTCCA. Knockout and rescue experiments revealed that only mRNA methylation sites containing the consensus motif depended on the presence of NSUN6. Furthermore, ribosome profiling demonstrated that NSUN6-specific consensus motifs marked translation termination. However, even though NSUN6-methylated mRNAs were reduced in NSUN6 knockout cells, NSUN6 was dispensable for mouse embryonic development. Thus, our study identifies NSUN6 as methyltransferase targeting mRNA in a sequence- and structure-specific manner.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140997	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1193	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkaa1193}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA591625	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA591625	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP233222	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and total RNA-seq from human H9 and HEK293 cells.

GSE76766	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by array	GPL18190	mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate ternary and eIF4F complex assembly	2016-01-12	mRNA translation plays a major role in homeostasis, whereas its dysregulation underpins a variety of pathological states including cancer, metabolic syndrome and neurological disorders. Ternary complex (TC) and eIF4F complex assembly are two major rate-limiting steps in translation initiation that are thought to be regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation, and the mTOR/4E-BP pathway, respectively2. However, how TC and eIF4F assembly are coordinated remains largely unknown. Using polysome-profiling, we show that on a genome-wide scale mTOR suppresses translation of mRNAs, which are translationally activated under short-term ER stress when TC recycling is attenuated by eIF2α phosphorylation. During acute nutrient or growth factor stimulation, mTORC1 induces eIF2β phosphorylation, which increases recruitment of NCK1 to eIF2, decreases eIF2α phosphorylation and bolsters TC recycling. Accordingly, eIF2β appears to act as a previously unidentified mediator of mTORC1 on protein synthesis and proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate a formerly undocumented role for CK2 in regulation of translation initiation, whereby CK2 stimulates phosphorylation of eIF2β and simultaneously bolsters eIF4F complex assembly via the mTORC1/4E-BP pathway. These findings imply a previously unrecognized mode of translation regulation whereby mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate TC and eIF4F complex assembly to stimulate cell proliferation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76766	Nature communications	11.878	https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11127	{Nature communications (11.878): 10.1038/ncomms11127}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA308553	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA308553	None	[Overal design]Comparisons of polysome-associated and cytoplasmic mRNA from starved cells or cells stimulated with insulin in the presence or absence of Torin-1.; [Treatment]'MCF7 cells were seeded in a 15 cm Petri dish, serum starved for 16 hours  (“control”) and then treated with 4.2 nM of recombinant human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours alone (“insulin”) or in combination with 250 nM torin1 (“insulin+torin1”).

Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants among humans. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA levels, translation, and protein abundance suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy - many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs. Our results reveal a new level of gene expression variation among humans and indicate that genetic variants can cause changes in protein levels through effects on translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65912	Genome research	9.944	https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.193342.115	{Genome research (9.944): 10.1101/gr.193342.115}	'cytoplasmic RNA', 'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA275386	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA275386	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP055009	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing experiments from human lymphoblastoid cells; [Treatment]'For ribosome profiling experiments, the cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to cell lysis.

Viruses depend on cellular molecules for their life cycle, which are attractive alternative targets, provided that they are dispensable for normal cell functions. Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we identify the ribosomal protein RACK1 as a cellular factor required for infection by internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing viruses. We further show that RACK1 is an essential determinant for hepatitis C virus translation and infection indicating that its function is conserved among distantly related human and fly viruses. Inhibition of RACK1 does not affect Drosophila or human cell viability and proliferation, and RACK1-silenced adult flies are viable, indicating that this protein is not essential for general translation. Our findings demonstrate a specific function for RACK1 in selective mRNA translation and uncover a new target for the development of broad antiviral intervention.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60374	Cell	36.216	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.041	{Cell (36.216): 10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.041}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA258133	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA258133	None	[Overal design]4 Controls 4 RACK1 silenced cells; [Treatment]'Cycloheximide treatment   Ribosome profiling begins with the preparation of cell lysates where ribosome-mRNA complexes accurately reflect in vivo translation.

This molecule inhibits ribosomal translocation yet does not lead to the disassembly of ribosomes from the mRNA. As an A37 ribosomes remain associated with the mRNA throughout the procedure. Since the effect of cycloheximide on ribosome translocation is instantaneous, it is assumed that the ribosomal association obtained truly represents the intracellular association.

The polysome-containing fraction (\uf07e 5 ml) is collected into a 50 ml falcon tube, mixed with one volume of 5M guanidine thiocyanate and two volumes of 100% ethanol, and stored at -20 °C over night.   The RNA from the collected fractions is precipitated by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with 5 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol and dissolved in 400 \uf06dl of RNase-free water. Finally, the RNA is precipitated with 0.1 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol and air dried.

GSE116233	Homo sapiens; Mus musculus	56	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573; GPL19057	Optimization of Ribosome Profiling Using Brain Tissue from Fragile X Mice	2018-06-25	Dysregulated protein synthesis is a major underlying cause of many neurodevelopmental diseases such as Fragile X Syndrome. A very robust technique is required to capture subtle but biologically significant differences in neurological disorders. Ribosome profiling, which is based on deep sequencing of mRNA fragments protected from ribonuclease digestion by ribosomes, is a powerful tool to study translational control. However, it has been mainly applied to rapidly dividing cells where translation is robust and where large amounts of starting material are readily available. The application of ribosome profiling to low-input brain tissue where translation is modest and where gene expression changes between genotypes are expected to be small has not been carefully evaluated. Using hippocampal tissue from wide type and fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we show that variable RNase digestion can lead to significant sample batch effects. We also establish GC content and ribosome footprint length as quality control metrics for ribonuclease digestion. We performed ribonuclease titration experiments for low-input samples to identify optimal conditions for this critical step that is often improperly conducted. Our data reveal that optimal RNase digestion is essential to ensure high quality and reproducibility of ribosome profiling especially for low-input brain tissue.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116233	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1292	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gky1292}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA477831	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA477831	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP151279	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling libraries of wild type mouse hippocampus were generated with different concentrations of ribonucleases and sequenced with Illumina Nextseq500. 5 experimental and 51 QC samples.; [Treatment]'None', 'iPSCs and iPSC-neurons were treated with 100ug/ul cycloheximide at 37°C for 1min and then washed with ice-cold PBS with 100ug/ul cycloheximide.

This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eIF2. However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a ~4.5-fold general translational repression, the protein coding ORFs of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated uORF that repress translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55195	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03971	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.03971}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA238879	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA238879	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP038695	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling of sodium arsenite treated cells for examination of translational response to induction of eIF2 phosphoylation; [Treatment]'40 µM sodium arsenite or vehicle were added and 30 mins later cells were harvested: dishes were immediately chilled on ice and washed with PBS+cycloheximide (100 ug/ml)'; [Growth]'Hek293T cells were grown in DMEM'; [Extraction]'Detergent lysis was performed in the dish, and after DNAse treatment sample was taken for mRNA isolation.

GSE80156	Homo sapiens; Mus musculus	7	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154; GPL13112	A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity	2016-04-11	Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The internal mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a post-decoding mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like “sticky” codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes codon “stickiness”. Further supporting the role of “sticky” sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes by minimizing the appearance of AUG-like codons in the frame 2. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80156	Research (Washington, D.C.)

Although mammals have two eIF4A paralogs, eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, their redundancy has been long assumed because of high homology and their functional difference has been poorly understood. Here we show that eIF4A paralogs employ differential translation programs. Ribosome profiling of eIF4A1- and eIF4A2-knockout HEK293T cell lines revealed that translation efficiency changes were divergent across transcriptome and distinct group of mRNAs were regulated by each paralog. Our analysis indicates that eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 facilitate translation of specific mRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126298	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA521496	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA521496	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP184677	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Rnase I footprinting, ribosome pelleting, RNA extraction\nRNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification (for ribosome profiling) or TruSeq (illumina) (for mRNA-seq)', 'Truseq stranded mRNA library prep\nRNA extraction, preadenylated linker ligation, rRNA depeletion, reverse transcription, cDNA circularization, PCR amplification (for ribosome profiling) or TruSeq (illumina) (for mRNA-seq)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''genetic background: WT; cell line: HEK293T; ', 'genetic background: EIF4A2KO; cell line: HEK293T; '

By allowing for reprogrammed translation, these mechanisms can mediate biological responses to stress stimuli. We combined proteomics with ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to identify the biological targets of translation control triggered by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), a protein implicated in the stringency of start codon selection. We quantified expression changes of over 4,000 proteins and 10,000 actively translated transcripts, leading to the identification of 245 transcripts undergoing translational control mediated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) upon eIF1 deprivation. The stringency of start codon selection and preference for optimal nucleotide context were largely diminished leading to translational regulation of uORFs with sub-optimal start sites. Affected genes were implicated in energy production and sensing of metabolic stress. Interestingly, knockdown of eIF1 elicited a synergic response from eIF5 and eIF1B.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87328	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx469	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkx469}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA344393	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA344393	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP090415	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and mRNA sequening of human HCT116 cells upon eIF1 knockdown and in control conditions.; [Treatment]'For knockdown experiments, HCT116 cells were transferred to serum-free McCoy’s medium and seeded at a density of 2.4*10E6 cells per 10 cm2 plate.

In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced usage of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells, but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132008	Cell reports	7.815	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.129	{Cell reports (7.815): 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.129}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA545624	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA545624	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP199981	[Overal design]Ribosome profiling (and complementary RNA-sequencing) was performed in HCT116 cells that received, via lentivirus, Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting either EIF5A, DOHH or non-targeting control sgRNAs.

GSE109343	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	25	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL13821; GPL17342; GPL19756	Lso2 is a conserved ribosome-bound protein required for translational recovery in yeast	2018-01-18	Ribosome binding proteins function broadly in protein synthesis, gene regulation and cellular homeostasis but the complete complement of functional ribosome-bound proteins remains unknown. Using quantitative mass spectrometry we identified Late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2) as a ribosome-associated protein that is broadly conserved in eukaryotes. Genome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of Lso2 and its human ortholog CCDC124 recovered 25S rRNA in a region near the A site that overlaps the GTPase activating center. Consistent with this location, Lso2 also crosslinked to most tRNAs. Ribosome profiling of yeast lacking LSO2 (lso2Δ) revealed global translation defects during recovery from stationary phase with translation of most genes reduced more than 4-fold. Ribosomes accumulated at start codons, were depleted from stop codons, and showed codon-specific changes in occupancy in lso2Δ. These defects, and the conservation of the specific ribosome-binding activity of Lso2/CCDC124, indicate broadly important functions in translation and physiology.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109343	PLoS biology	8.386	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005903	{PLoS biology (8.386): 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005903}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA430526	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA430526	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP131127	[Overal design]Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by deep sequencing: 5 IP samples of Lso2 and CCDC124, 6 controls of size-matched input and untagged IP.

GSE97140	Homo sapiens	11	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL15456	Methylation of human eukaryotic elongation factor alpha (eEF1A) by a member of a novel protein lysine methyltransferase family modulates mRNA translation	2017-03-28	Many cellular proteins are post-translationally modified by methylation of lysine residues. This has been most intensively studied in the case of histone proteins, where lysine methylations in the flexible tails are determinants of chromatin state and gene expression. Lysine methylations on non-histone proteins are also frequent, but in most cases the functional significance of the methylation event, as well as the identity of the responsible lysine (K) specific methyltransferase (KMT), remain unknown. While the majority of identified human KMTs belong to the SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax)-domain class of methyltransferases (MTases), several recently discovered KMTs belong to a different MTase class, the seven-beta-strand (7BS) MTases. Here, we have investigated an uncharacterized human 7BS MTase currently annotated as being part of the endothelin converting enzyme 2 (ECE2). However, transcriptomics data indicate that this MTase is not part of ECE2, and should be considered a separate protein. Combining in vitro enzymology and analyses of knockout cells, we demonstrate that this MTase efficiently methylates K36 in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that this novel KMT is named eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name EEF1AKMT4), in agreement with the recently established nomenclature. Furthermore, by ribosome profiling we show that the absence of K36 methylation affects translation dynamics and changes translation speed of distinct codons. Finally, we demonstrate that eEF1A-KMT4 is part of a novel family of human KMTs, defined by a shared sequence motif in the active site, and we show the importance of this motif for catalytic activity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97140	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx432	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkx432}	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA380795	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA380795	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP102616	"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and RNAseq data for wt and EEF1AKMT4 knockout cells.

GSE158044	Homo sapiens	30	Other	GPL16791; GPL21290	Activation of the antiviral factor RNase L triggers translation of non-coding mRNA sequences	2020-09-16	Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is activated as part of the innate immune response and plays an important role in the clearance of viral infections. When activated, it endonucleolytically cleaves both viral and host RNAs, leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis. However, it remains unknown how widespread RNA decay, and consequent changes in the translatome, promote the elimination of viruses. To study how this altered transcriptome is translated, we assayed the global distribution of ribosomes in RNase L activated human cells with ribosome profiling. We found that RNase L activation leads to a substantial increase in the fraction of translating ribosomes in ORFs internal to coding sequences (iORFs) and ORFs within 5’ and 3’ UTRs (uORFs and dORFs). Translation of these alternative ORFs was dependent on RNase L’s cleavage activity, suggesting that mRNA decay fragments are translated to produce short peptides that may be important for antiviral activity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158044	Nucleic acids research	11.147	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab036	{Nucleic acids research (11.147): 10.1093/nar/gkab036}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA663848	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA663848	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP282584	"[Overal design]30 Ribsome profiling datasets on 2-5A or poly I:C treated or untreated A549 lung carcinoma cells.; [Treatment]'2-5A and poly I:C were transfected by Lipofectamine 3000.

We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in TLR2-stimulated macrophages revealed that IFN-g selectively modulates the macrophage translatome to promote inflammation, further reprogram metabolic pathways, and modulate protein synthesis.

GSE78807	Oikopleura dioica	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL21546	Genome-wide profiling of mTOR-dependent translation in Oikopleura dioica	2016-03-01	Protein synthesis is an energy-demanding process essential for cell proliferation and survival. Balancing the cost of protein synthesis with available resources has driven the evolution of its nutrient-dependent regulation. A central mechanism in this regulation is the repression of translation of the protein synthesis machinery during unfavorable growth conditions. This is mediated via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of growth conserved from yeast to human. Despite extensive research, and the elucidation of a number of important factors, how mRNAs are translationally regulated by mTOR is still unclear. Repression depends on a 5’ Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine (TOP) motif which is conserved across vertebrates and present in Drosophila melanogaster. In Caenorhabditis elegans and the marine chordate Oikopleura dioica most TOP mRNAs are trans-spliced to a spliced leader. This results in the removal of the originally transcribed 5’ end and its replacement with a common short RNA sequence. In both species the 5’ end of the spliced leader is pyrimidine-enriched but does not meet strict requirements for a canonical TOP motif. How this affects the translational control of TOP mRNAs is unknown. Here, using transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling on whole animals treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, we show that trans-spliced TOP mRNAs in O. dioica are subject to mTOR-dependent translational control. We also show, using existing data, that trans-spliced transcripts in C. elegans are differentially translated upon recovery from starvation-induced developmental diapause. Together our results demonstrate that spliced leaders in metazoans are targets for mTOR-dependent translational control in response to nutrient availability. This indicates that trans-splicing in metazoans, the function of which has remained largely enigmatic, plays a key role in the coordinated translational regulation of growth-related genes. Moreover, our results reveal an innovative strategy for rapid evolution and developmental control of downstream targets of the ancient mTOR pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78807	BMC genomics	3.501	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6277-x	{BMC genomics (3.501): 10.1186/s12864-019-6277-x}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA314019	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA314019	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP071049	[Overal design]Ribosome-protected RNA fragments and total RNA extracted from animals treated with mTOR inhibitor Torin 1 and control animals (DMSO) in three biological replicates (12 samples in total) sequenced on two lanes on each of two Illumina flow cells; [Treatment]'Animals were placed into beakers of seawater containing normal algal food dose for day 6 and either 1 μM Torin 1 (treatment) or 1 μM DMSO (vehicle control).

The molecular fingerprint for this rare, severe and unique clinical entity is still not elucidated. The goal of the present work was to detect both gene expression levels and alternate RNA splice variants specific to IBC. Experimental Design: In order to identify differentially expressed genes and splicing events, we performed splice-sensitive array profiling using Affymetrix Exon Array and quantitative RT-PCR analyses in a large series of 177 IBC compared to 183 non-IBC. We also assessed the prognostic value of the identified candidate genes and splice variants. Results: A 5-splice signature (HSPA8, RPL10, RPL4, DIDO1 and EVL) was able to distinguish IBC from non-IBC tumors (p<10-7). This splice signature was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) in hormone receptor-negative non-IBC (p=0.02), whereas it had no prognostic value in IBC patients. A PAM analysis of deregulated genes in IBC compared to non-IBC identified a 10-gene signature highly predictive of IBC phenotype and conferring a poor prognosis in non-IBC. The most up-regulated genes in IBC were 3 hemoglobin genes able to highly discriminate IBC from non IBC (p<10-4). In epithelial breast tumor cells, Hb protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: IBC has a specific spliced transcript profile that deserves further functional studies. Above all, IBC is characterized by hemoglobin genes overexpression, a fact that may lead to increased tumor progression. If confirmed, hemoglobins may serve as therapeutic targets.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111477	Journal of advanced research	5.045	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jare.2020.08.009	{Journal of advanced research (5.045): 10.1016/j.jare.2020.08.009}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA437146	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA437146	None	[Overal design]Training set of 33 IBC and 28 non IBC; [Treatment]'NA'; [Growth]'NA'; [Extraction]'Rneasy (Qiagen)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''condition: Non-Inflammatory; ', 'condition: Inflammatory; '

This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric, which potentially adds an additional layer of variety and dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The m6A-modified mRNA can be selectively recognized by the YTH family “reader” proteins. The preferential binding of m6A-containing mRNA by YTHDF2 is known to reduce the stability of the target transcripts; however, the exact effects of m6A on translation has yet to be elucidated. Here we show that another m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, promotes ribosome loading of its target transcripts. YTHDF1 forms a complex with translation initiation factors to elevate the translation efficiency of its bound mRNA. In a unified mechanism of translation control through m6A, the YTHDF2-mediated decay controls the lifetime of target transcripts; whereas, the YTHDF1-based translation promotion increases the translation efficiency to ensure effective protein production from relatively short-lived transcripts that are marked by m6A.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63591	Cell	36.216	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.014	{Cell (36.216): 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.014}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA268354	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA268354	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP050213	[Overal design]PAR-CLIP and RIP was used to identify YTHDF1 binding sites followed by ribosome profling and RNA seq to assess the consequences of YTHDF1 siRNA knock-down; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Truseq small RNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'Truseq stranded mRNA sample prepration kit (illumina)', 'NEBNext small RNA library prep set for Illumina (NEB)', 'Isolate from surcrose gradient, recovered by trizol\nTruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kits (Illumina)', 'Extract by trizol, then poly(A) selection\nTruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kits (Illumina)'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: over-express N-terminal flag-tagged YTHDF1 for 24h (0.75ug plasmid/mL); sample treatment and extract: fed with 4SU, UV crosslink, partial digested by RNase T1, anti-flag-beads IP; ', 'cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: over-express N-terminal flag-tagged YTHDF1 for 24h (0.75ug plasmid/mL); sample treatment and extract: anti-flag-beads IP; ', 'cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: over-express N-terminal flag-tagged YTHDF1 for 24h (0.75ug plasmid/mL); sample treatment and extract: Extract by trizol, then poly-dT beads pull-down; ', 'cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: over-express N-terminal flag-tagged YTHDF1 for 24h(0.75ug plasmid/mL); sample treatment and extract: Extract by trizol, then rRNA removal; ', 'cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; sample treatment and extract: Isolate from surcrose gradient, recovered by trizol; ', 'cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; sample treatment and extract: Extract by trizol, then rRNA removal; ', 'cell line: HeLa; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; sample treatment and extract: Extracy by trizol, then rRNA removal; ', 'cell line: HeLa; transfection: siControl-RPF; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; ', 'cell line: HeLa; transfection: siControl; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; ', 'cell line: HeLa; transfection: SiMETTL3-RPF; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; ', 'cell line: HeLa; transfection: SiMETTL3; cell treatment: 40nM siRNA knock-down for 48h; '
GSE120159	Homo sapiens	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Targeting the eIF4A dependent translation of KRAS and other oncoproteins in pancreatic cancer	2018-09-18	New and effective therapeutics are urgently needed for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The eIF4A/DDX2 RNA helicase drives translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5’UTRs. The natural compound silvestrol and synthetic analogues are potent and selective inhibitors of eIF4A1/2 that show promising activity in models of hematological malignancies. Here, we show silvestrol analogues have nanomolar activity against PDAC cell lines and organoids in vitro. Moreover, we see single agent activity in the KRAS/p53 mouse PDAC model and also against PDAC xenografts and primary, patient derived PDAC tumors. These therapeutic effects occur at non-toxic dose levels. Transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling, analyses of protein and gene expression, and translation reporter studies reveal that eIF4A inhibitors block an oncogenic translation program in PDAC cells that includes G-quadruplex containing mRNAs such as KRAS, MYC, YAP1, MET, SMAD3, TGFβ and others. Together, our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A disrupts oncoprotein production and shows efficacy across several PDAC models.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120159	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA491747	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA491747	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP162072	[Overal design]We performed ribosome footprinting and RNA sequencing on six samples of PANC1 cells including three untreated samples (DMSO) and three samples that were collected 45 minutes after treatment with CR31B (25 nM).

GSE110868	Mus musculus	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13112	Identification and validation of GPD1 as an essential cancer stem cell specific target in glioblastoma (RNA-seq: Gpd1 KO)	2018-02-20	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, however, little is known about how to target CSCs without affecting the normal stem cell population. Here we report the ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells and brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which leads to the identification of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) as a CSC- specific determinant. We confirmed that GPD1 is expressed in BTSCs but not in neural stem cells. Intriguingly, expression of GPD1 is only found in the infiltrating dormant BTSCs in vivo and these cells start to divide and drive tumour relapse after chemotherapy. Most importantly, inhibition of GPD1 expression in tumour-bearing mice leads to prolonged survival. Further analysis shows that loss of GPD1 results in widespread changes in important pathways affecting BTSC maintenance. Human patient data analysis suggests that GPD1 is expressed in the dormant infiltrating tumour cells in human glioblastoma and the expression level is associated with a worse prognosis. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumours and a novel aspect of regulation of CSC dormancy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110868	None	None	None	None	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA434718	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA434718	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP133177	[Overal design]Two sgRNAs guided Gpd1 knock out in mouse brain tumor stem cells; [Treatment]'From the colonies of interest DNA was purified and sequenced to prove the GPD1 KO.

Gel slices between 26-34 nt were excised and the RNA was extracted using a 450 μl gel extraction buffer (0.5 M Ammonium acetate and 0.05% SDS) for 2 hours at room temperature and with gentle agitation. Gel pieces were removed by centrifugation over Spin-X filter tubes (Corning) for 2 min at 15,000 x g. RNA was precipitated over night at -20°C in the presence of 1 ml 100% ethanol and 3 μl glycogen.

Specifically, to reduce rRNA contamination for these species (and thus reduce the number of sequencing reads needed for in-depth analyses), first strand cDNAs derived from species specific rRNA contaminants were further depleted after circularization by hybridization to 5’-biotinylated sense strand oligonucleotides followed by removal of the duplexes through streptavidin affinity as previously described. PCR amplification of the circularized cDNA product was done using the TruSeq Ribo Profile (Mammalian) Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
